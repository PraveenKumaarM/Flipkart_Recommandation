If that is not your concern you can just blindly go for it.\n",

The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone, lovely weight balance. The in hand feel is amazing it's so lite that I barely feel it in my pocket. The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: On first day phone screen went complete black while running some backup restore but after hard reset phone is working fine and not faced any problem. I was looking for compact phone for single hand use. Camera and battery life is good.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Amazing camera. Loved the design and look and feel of the phone. Battery could have been better. However it works for me. Light weight as well. Overall its a really good phone. Didnt like iphone much from the store. Moreover it felt like I am giving up too many features in iphone and the price range is similar.  Hence got the s23 and I absolutely love this phone.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: User experience is amazing. Display and performance are top notch! Camera is also really nice, best part, photos are natural. The only draw back is battery backup and heating issue, if these two things were better this would have been the best flagship in this range.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it for 50k with emi for that price it's really good and best of the best , I was having a bit confusion when I thought of upgrading my phone. When the sale came s23 had a offer so I bought it, now Im not regretting my choice ❤️\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was using iPhone for a long time while switching back to Android I had my doubts but this phone absolutely crush the iphone last I used was 12 pro and got 14 pro for my friend well i still don't think it can go toe to toe against 14 pro but other than that it will be absolute winner in camera display sound battery backup and now there is call background we can have full screen photo on caller ID one of the thing i loved about ios and it's in this too go for it don't think twice.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price. Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsive Battery backup is ok for one day use Camera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also good Videography is good Good refresh rate One hand phone Only drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I switched my phone after 3.5 yrs and it's really a good phone.  Good battery life for an average user like me. Display and design both are awesome. It clicks good photos.. both day and night. The phone is really fast and smooth  Finger print scanner is also great except one or two times. Metallic side designs is also great\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Exchanged iPhone 11 for this. Worth it. Had very bad experience with Android but man this phone is buttery smooth.  No heating. Battery is excellent. Ui is clean and easy to use and customise. Small and handy. Very beautiful design. Kudos Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I've used it for a month now and I can say one thing for sure, This is the best phone I've used till now. I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is the what i am waiting for. Now i am loving it all. Camera is awesome Battery is pretty good Display is totally smooth Speaker is clear and loud It's perfect compact flagship. You must go for it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone by exchanging one plus 7t, I went to shop for purchasing one plus 11, iPhone 13 or 14 but after seeing this phone I changed my mind within less than 5 minutes, as I wanted phone with best photography, yes I am fully satisfied with camera but battery completely disappointing, I went to Dubai where I had to carry Power bank always to ensure phone does go dead, in a day I had to charge 2 times. Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

Overall a lovely experience go for it.. If u r confused bw iphone and samsung go for it and u will not be disappointed. 😊\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After using for about 1 month; its a fantastic phone Rather blabbering, i will tell the key points 1. No heating issues 2. Great battery backup; lasts upto 1 day on moderate usage 3. Awesome display and its feel 4. Works flawlessly with galaxy watch 4 and buds 2 5. No lagging 6. Easy to hold in hands 7. Knox is best 8. Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent  But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month. 1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive. 2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

My opinion 1. Design/ build quality: 5/5 for a compact phone 2. Performance: 5/5 not even a single issue or lag faced till now awesome optimization 3. Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5. Overview: one if the best compact phone to buy for official use\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

Camera quality is fantastic and better than iPhone 13 or iPhone 14. Night mode image is also good. Power full Snapdragon processer Fast fingerprint High brightness - No issue in outdoor. AI Features are available Gaming is OK. I am not a big gamer.  Cons: Sounds quality is Ok but not better than the iPhone. I have an iPhone 13, so I am able to compare. The battery back is OK, if the screen time is 6 hours then you can use the mobile for the whole day. If you use the power saving mode, then the battery lasts 1 and half days in moderate use. It will be a great deal if you purchase under 50k.\n",

Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: I've ordered the device on Flipkart and to my surprise the device has heating issues. With just a couple of software updates the device heated up. I ignored it the first day thinking it might be normal as it's first use and there are apps updating also I received the device late evening that day. The next morning I tried to take a couple of photos (I used the camera app for 30 seconds at most) and then again it heated up. Now waiting for Flipkart to process my return (although I lost my old device due to exchange and Flipkart won't credit that exchange value to you and rather give it as a Flipkart voucher). Flipkart isn't ready to accept the fact and is not processing the return as of now. They keep disconnecting the calls and rejecting the return requests. Have to see how this goes.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

Camera picture quality is good. Only issue is when using apps and multitasking phone does hang for few seconds. When scrolling ecommerce sites ,frequency back and forth happens phone ll stop for atleast for 5 secs . Samsung keyboard is not user friendly, no matter what we type it will suggest it's own words.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

Camera picture quality is good. Only issue is when using apps and multitasking phone does hang for few seconds. When scrolling ecommerce sites ,frequency back and forth happens phone ll stop for atleast for 5 secs . Samsung keyboard is not user friendly, no matter what we type it will suggest it's own words.

Great camera quality and great video recording capabilities thanks to super stabilised video.  Battery is great too if you don't Play too much heavy games then it will last whole day.  Display is the best in the segment super bright and punchy, colours are just awesome ofcourse it is a Samsung display.  Man the processor.... What a great processor built by Qualcomm. Super powerful and battery efficient. You can throw any task it doesn't matter.  Everything is good you can go for it only the price a little higher side... If that is not your concern you can just blindly go for it.\n",

The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",

The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was using iPhone for a long time while switching back to Android I had my doubts but this phone absolutely crush the iphone last I used was 12 pro and got 14 pro for my friend well i still don't think it can go toe to toe against 14 pro but other than that it will be absolute winner in camera display sound battery backup and now there is call background we can have full screen photo on caller ID one of the thing i loved about ios and it's in this too go for it don't think twice.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price.

      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

If l compare it to my iPhone , It leads in photography,display, refresh rate and ties with iPhone 13 in performance.The two sectors where s23 is behind iPhone 13 are Speakers and battery life . And Lastly,both of the UI's are great .\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros- 1. Battery is surprisingly good for a compact form factor. 2. OneUI is so well polished for this S23. And excellent software update support. 3. Camera is one of the best in the industry. 4. Snapdragon 8 Gen2 is a beast. Powerful as well as efficient.  Cons- 1. Can get warm sometime. 2. Charging speed is slow at 25W, should have been 45W instead.  Verdict- Best is class (Compact True Flagship)\n",

A lot of customisation. And last u r getting a computer.. by connecting it to a monitor thru samsung dex.  Cons- only battery charging time and battery is kind of low.  Overall a lovely experience go for it.. If u r confused bw iphone and samsung go for it and u will not be disappointed. 😊\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After using for about 1 month; its a fantastic phone Rather blabbering, i will tell the key points 1. No heating issues 2. Great battery backup; lasts upto 1 day on moderate usage 3. Awesome display and its feel 4. Works flawlessly with galaxy watch 4 and buds 2 5. No lagging 6. Easy to hold in hands 7. Knox is best 8. Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent  But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month. 1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive. 2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this device for almost a year now, am just loving with device day by day❤️ especially security (knox), optimization, AI features of UI is too good.. My opinion 1. Design/ build quality: 5/5 for a compact phone 2. Performance: 5/5 not even a single issue or lag faced till now awesome optimization 3. Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5. Overview: one if the best compact phone to buy for official use\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: One of the best phones money can buy. But you will be left wanting for bigger battery and fast charging. 8/10\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Iam sharing my experience after 12 days of excessive use Display is top notch you can feel how premium it is. Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's a great phone to buy if u are looking for compact phone, but dont do the same mistake as I did . buy a thin slim case to enjoy the phones slim bezels . I bought a armored case and now besels looks thick\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The best compact phone in the market unless u get hands on asus zenfone 10.  The best part is its battery life which is excellent for a phone of this size and battery capacity With moderate to light use u can easily churn out between 6-7 hrs of SOT, heavy use 5-6 hrs  The display as always is fluid and bright  The phone feels great in hand due to its form factor  Cameras are good too  Main Camera 8.5/10 Wide angle 7.5/10 Telephoto 7.5/10 Portraits 8.5/10 Night 8.5/10 Selfie 8/10  How don't how samsung has managed to optimize this phone with such great efficiency and power.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Switching from ios to android I thought I would regret it but I was wrong. The display and os is excellent. I recommend downloading the Goodlock from samsung store.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best in class display, best in class camera (atleast for pictires), really amazing design it's very compact and feels great in hand. SD 8 gen 2 means no issues with performance. Overall a perfect phone for those who are looking to buy a small sized phone which should also be a flagship.  Update after 1 week - Battery is still on the lower end, but that's expected for a phone this small. The AI is still learning the usage patterns so I hope it'll get better.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Wonderful phone after using the Poco F1 for the last 5 years. This phone feels like a drastic change. The camera is wonderful, the display is amazing, and the performance is top-notch. The battery life is a bit low, but otherwise, it's an excellent phone to buy. I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Honest Review after using 1 month_ Pros: Look and build quality is definitely premium. You feel when you unbox and hold the product. Display and touch are just awesome. Camera quality is fantastic and better than iPhone 13 or iPhone 14. Night mode image is also good. Power full Snapdragon processer Fast fingerprint High brightness - No issue in outdoor. AI Features are available Gaming is OK. I am not a big gamer.  Cons: Sounds quality is Ok but not better than the iPhone. I have an iPhone 13, so I am able to compare. The battery back is OK, if the screen time is 6 hours then you can use the mobile for the whole day. If you use the power saving mode, then the battery lasts 1 and half days in moderate use. It will be a great deal if you purchase under 50k.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: I've ordered the device on Flipkart and to my surprise the device has heating issues. With just a couple of software updates the device heated up. I ignored it the first day thinking it might be normal as it's first use and there are apps updating also I received the device late evening that day. The next morning I tried to take a couple of photos (I used the camera app for 30 seconds at most) and then again it heated up. Now waiting for Flipkart to process my return (although I lost my old device due to exchange and Flipkart won't credit that exchange value to you and rather give it as a Flipkart voucher). Flipkart isn't ready to accept the fact and is not processing the return as of now. They keep disconnecting the calls and rejecting the return requests. Have to see how this goes.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",

Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price. Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsive Battery backup is ok for one day use Camera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also good Videography is good Good refresh rate One hand phone Only drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",

Great battery backup; lasts upto 1 day on moderate usage 3. Awesome display and its feel 4. Works flawlessly with galaxy watch 4 and buds 2 5. No lagging 6. Easy to hold in hands 7. Knox is best 8. Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent  But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month. 1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive. 2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5. Overview: one if the best compact phone to buy for official use\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",

Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Iam sharing my experience after 12 days of excessive use Display is top notch you can feel how premium it is. Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

Camera quality is fantastic and better than iPhone 13 or iPhone 14. Night mode image is also good. Power full Snapdragon processer Fast fingerprint High brightness - No issue in outdoor. AI Features are available Gaming is OK. I am not a big gamer.  Cons: Sounds quality is Ok but not better than the iPhone. I have an iPhone 13, so I am able to compare. The battery back is OK, if the screen time is 6 hours then you can use the mobile for the whole day. If you use the power saving mode, then the battery lasts 1 and half days in moderate use.

I ignored it the first day thinking it might be normal as it's first use and there are apps updating also I received the device late evening that day. The next morning I tried to take a couple of photos (I used the camera app for 30 seconds at most) and then again it heated up. Now waiting for Flipkart to process my return (although I lost my old device due to exchange and Flipkart won't credit that exchange value to you and rather give it as a Flipkart voucher). Flipkart isn't ready to accept the fact and is not processing the return as of now. They keep disconnecting the calls and rejecting the return requests. Have to see how this goes.\n",

The camera is top notch best camera in this segment and display too is marvelous, The processor too is good but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the heating problem.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

Can handle the day to day life easily but for heavy task Exynos failed. They can easily provide Snapdragon but every time this Exynos chip has broken my heart. As though I am a die hurt fan of Samsung still I hv to say not satisfied with the Exynos chip..\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using since November. Not that flagship feel. Durable phone. Battrey os good enough. Network is an issue, I've used multiple sims at different locations and found that it's the phone. Other phones are doing great in this term. Major thing is this phone heats... it's in red hot form whenever you'll use it for multitasking more than half an hour. In this summer time it's too hot to use. Even using rubber backcase you will feel the heat. And scree is also hot.  If you are Samsung interface lover and wants Samsung only like me... then you should go with S21FE in same budget.\n",

Fast Fingerprint sensor 4. Audio quality super. 5. Battery hold almost for a day even in heavy use not gaming. 6. gaming experience very smooth without any lag. 7.

No charger, no back cover, i think when we buy expensive phone, we deserve both of them.. 5. rest things just fine, will add on review if get anything else..\n",

Great camera quality and great video recording capabilities thanks to super stabilised video.  Battery is great too if you don't Play too much heavy games then it will last whole day.  Display is the best in the segment super bright and punchy, colours are just awesome ofcourse it is a Samsung display.  Man the processor.... What a great processor built by Qualcomm. Super powerful and battery efficient. You can throw any task it doesn't matter.  Everything is good you can go for it only the price a little higher side... If that is not your concern you can just blindly go for it.\n",

The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone, lovely weight balance. The in hand feel is amazing it's so lite that I barely feel it in my pocket. The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

Hence got the s23 and I absolutely love this phone.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: User experience is amazing. Display and performance are top notch! Camera is also really nice, best part, photos are natural. The only draw back is battery backup and heating issue, if these two things were better this would have been the best flagship in this range.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice design , handy phone night Camra awesome\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was using iPhone for a long time while switching back to Android I had my doubts but this phone absolutely crush the iphone last I used was 12 pro and got 14 pro for my friend well i still don't think it can go toe to toe against 14 pro but other than that it will be absolute winner in camera display sound battery backup and now there is call background we can have full screen photo on caller ID one of the thing i loved about ios and it's in this too go for it don't think twice.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price. Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsive Battery backup is ok for one day use Camera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also good Videography is good Good refresh rate One hand phone Only drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge.\n",

It clicks good photos.. both day and night. The phone is really fast and smooth  Finger print scanner is also great except one or two times. Metallic side designs is also great\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Exchanged iPhone 11 for this. Worth it. Had very bad experience with Android but man this phone is buttery smooth.  No heating. Battery is excellent. Ui is clean and easy to use and customise. Small and handy. Very beautiful design. Kudos Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I've used it for a month now and I can say one thing for sure, This is the best phone I've used till now. I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is the what i am waiting for. Now i am loving it all. Camera is awesome Battery is pretty good Display is totally smooth Speaker is clear and loud It's perfect compact flagship. You must go for it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall better than any other phone except for s23ultra😉\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone by exchanging one plus 7t, I went to shop for purchasing one plus 11, iPhone 13 or 14 but after seeing this phone I changed my mind within less than 5 minutes, as I wanted phone with best photography, yes I am fully satisfied with camera but battery completely disappointing, I went to Dubai where I had to carry Power bank always to ensure phone does go dead, in a day I had to charge 2 times. Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

A lot of customisation. And last u r getting a computer.. by connecting it to a monitor thru samsung dex.  Cons- only battery charging time and battery is kind of low.  Overall a lovely experience go for it.. If u r confused bw iphone and samsung go for it and u will not be disappointed. 😊\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After using for about 1 month; its a fantastic phone Rather blabbering, i will tell the key points 1. No heating issues 2. Great battery backup; lasts upto 1 day on moderate usage 3. Awesome display and its feel 4. Works flawlessly with galaxy watch 4 and buds 2 5. No lagging 6. Easy to hold in hands 7. Knox is best 8. Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent  But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month. 1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive. 2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",

Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

Camera quality is fantastic and better than iPhone 13 or iPhone 14. Night mode image is also good. Power full Snapdragon processer Fast fingerprint High brightness - No issue in outdoor. AI Features are available Gaming is OK. I am not a big gamer.  Cons: Sounds quality is Ok but not better than the iPhone. I have an iPhone 13, so I am able to compare. The battery back is OK, if the screen time is 6 hours then you can use the mobile for the whole day. If you use the power saving mode, then the battery lasts 1 and half days in moderate use. It will be a great deal if you purchase under 50k.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

I ignored it the first day thinking it might be normal as it's first use and there are apps updating also I received the device late evening that day. The next morning I tried to take a couple of photos (I used the camera app for 30 seconds at most) and then again it heated up. Now waiting for Flipkart to process my return (although I lost my old device due to exchange and Flipkart won't credit that exchange value to you and rather give it as a Flipkart voucher). Flipkart isn't ready to accept the fact and is not processing the return as of now. They keep disconnecting the calls and rejecting the return requests. Have to see how this goes.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera and a performance Beast! Been using it for 10 days now and here's the summary:-  PROS: -Camera__Nightography is insanely good. Beats iPhone14 and other top flagship phones by far. Portraits are a bliss for the eyes, feels like shot from DSLR. -Performance__Super smooth performance with 8 gen 1. Can handle any mobile games flawlessly. Played BGMI and Asphalt 9 and there are hardly any frame drops even after an hour. -Display__Display is too good. Peak brightness is enough and works brilliantly even during noon. Bezels are so slim it feels like holding just the screen. -Design__In hand feel is Premium. Thought the s22 would be smaller but it actually fits perfectly and probably better than the s22+. Back glass looks super Premium.  CONS -Battey__It's a big setback for this flagship Beast. Lasts 24hrs only in standby or if you pass half the time not using the phone. Barely lasts 12 hrs with a little bit of camera and ~1hr of gaming. Reason for a less star -Heating__Heats a lot while playing games or recording videos. Would suggest doing these without a back cover for better performance.  OVERALL it's a steal @39999 just for the camera and performance. I genuinely prefer only these 2 and it doesn't bother me to charge the phone a couple of times or carry a powerbank so the cons are fine by me. But if you want your phone to last for a day or prefer bigger screen/storage there are better options in this price range.  Hope this helps 😃\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact flagship phone with a beautiful design, great cameras, and fast software updates. However, its battery life is underwhelming, and it has high idle battery drain.  Pros:  Beautiful design Great camera Fast software updates Compact size  Cons:  Bad battery life High idle battery drain  Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 is a great phone, but its battery life is a major drawback. If you're looking for a compact flagship phone with a great camera and fast software updates, the S22 is a good option, but be prepared to carry a charger with you.  Here are some additional thoughts on the S22's battery life:  The S22 has a relatively small battery, at 3,700mAh. This is less than the batteries in many other flagship phones.  The S22's battery life can be especially poor if you use it for demanding tasks, such as gaming or video streaming.  S22 has high idle battery drain, meaning that it loses battery even when you're not using it actively.  If you're considering buying an S22, it's important to be aware of its battery life limitations. If you're a heavy user, or if you need your phone to last all day on a single charge, you may want to consider a different phone.  As battery backup isn't an issue for me hence giving 4 stars.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing this device review after 15 days of using, I got this phone at 34k. This is a fully packed mobile with lots of good features and specs. Battery easily lasts for more than 5.5hrs (100% to 25-20%) in simple + moderate use (on 60hz) and also 25watt charging is superfast according to 3700 mah battery capacity. It tooks 50-60 minutes to get fully charged and in 20 minutes, it charges the device to 50% with original Samsung Charger. This phone targets simple user who are not always active on their mobile screen. Camera, Performance, Display, In-Hand feeling all are really premium. Please do update to the latest Android version for smooth experience and good battery life. During first 3-4 days, the UI will learn your usage pattern and then it will optimise the phone's battery according to your usage and i also don't feel any kind of over heating while testing it with heavy games and application, it only gets warm which is very common in every phone. If you're a heavy user or looking for good battery phone which can last upto or more than 6hrs, then go with OnePlus and IQOO. I was also looking for Nothing phone 2 but it is still a new brand so trust issues are obvious. I was looking for a handy and flat display phone with Clean UI and good features, This device really matched my requirements. ***Review after 6-7 months of usage (Using OneUI 6.1)*** This is a really nice smartphone at this price range. Charging was something for which i was feeling gutted but there is not any issue like that. From Display, Charging, Performance, Camera, Fast Charging, Compact Looks and all the major factors it is truly a worthy deal if you're getting it in between 30k to 35k (depends on Bank offer etc.). Battery is lasting for more than 6hrs 30min. from 85-80% to 25-20% in moderate usage. Many users have complaint about its heating issue, but this is not an issue. Every smartphone gets WARM during usage and while charging. There is a major difference between WARM and HEAT. So just go for it without any hesitation.\n",

But believe me after buying this phone even though I got less screen time but after using 2 to 3 weeks the phone gets adapt to the usage and gets optimized and I have easily got about 4.5 to 5 hours easily and I am a moderate user casual games, video streaming, social media and lot of phone calls. Don't revert your decision hearing from people about it's battery believe me it's worth it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall the performance of the mobile is excellent. Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact high end device with every feature integrated inside it.

      "Rating: 5, Review: The Samsung S22 is a phone that has some great features, but also some significant drawbacks. One of the biggest issues with this phone is its battery life. The battery drains quickly, even with normal use, and it can be frustrating to constantly have to charge the phone throughout the day. This is definitely a disadvantage for users who are always on-the-go and need a phone that can keep up with their busy lifestyle.  However, the Samsung S22 also has some standout features that make it a worthwhile purchase for some users. The display on this phone is fantastic, with crisp and vibrant colors that really pop. Whether you're watching videos, browsing the internet, or playing games, the display is sure to impress.  Another area where the Samsung S22 excels is in its performance. The phone is equipped with a powerful Snapdragon processor that delivers fast and smooth performance for all your daily tasks. Whether you're multitasking between apps or running demanding games, the Samsung S22 can handle it all with ease.  Overall, the Samsung S22 is a phone that has its ups and downs. While the battery life can be frustrating, the display and performance are both excellent. If you prioritize a great display and fast performance over battery life, then the Samsung S22 may be the perfect phone for you.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Before I proceed with the review, let me tell you that this is going to be my secondary device. My primary device is still an iPhone. As a secondary device, this is an all-round good phone.  Here are some of my initial impressions-  1. Good display with adequate outdoor brightness. 2. Compact size- this is one of the best features of this phone. 3. Good set of cameras. 4. Some useful features like Samsung Pay, DeX mode comes handy at times. 5. Performance is good- no major lag while casually using the device. 6. Heating is there, but it's manageable. 7. Speakers are decent. 8. Fingerprint scanner is somewhat good. If you have really dry hands (which some of us have during winters), then fingerprint scanner becomes unreliable at times. 9. Battery is decent. If you casually use this device, then the device will last for a typical working day. If you're a medium or heavy user, then please be prepared to carry a power-bank with you. 10. Build quality is good.  To conclude, I would say, if you're getting this device under 40K, and you're in market for a compact device, then go for this one. Remember, this phone is not meant for heavy usage. And as a secondary device, this serves the purpose well.\n",

Camera is also great up to the mark But when comes to battery device goes down .. Observed heating issue while using camera. Over all iam satisfied with the device .  And I was planning to give 5 star rating but due to 2 factors I I have rated the device 4 only 1. As already mentioned battery is too low compared with other phones in market . 2. In case of this full credit goes to Flipkart ...they are charging. 40 rupees for secure packing .but till now I couldn't find out what safety was there ... same old package of Flipkart with out any changes no any airbubles protection nothing just the paper box ..and we are paying extra rupees for this same packing. @flipkart requesting your team to add any special secure package for fragile things and charge the money. Just for the old package please don't charge any extras. If the secure package was ok then also I would have rated as 5.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using S22 for 1 month now .S22 is Good works well everything is perfect expect Battery backup (specificly if you use 120 hz then it will last for 4 hours in light uses.If you use battery saver then S22 will give upto 6 hours according to your use). Don't expect to do gaming on this phone because of battery and heat ya you can play light games . S22 camera is fabulious just amezing its the best camera phone under 40k even s22 camera beats i phone 13. If you are looking for compact phone and you are not heavy user just casual then go for it. If you are someone who only sticks to the phone all day long then you have to charge it 3 times a day . Its not a big deal for me i am not heavy user it easily last all day for me . And ya if you use camera more then phone will heat and as a result battery will drain . And remeber this phone is not for gaming.\n",

Even with Wifi, Mobile network being off it dies down Major issue that I have is poor face and fingerprint detection. Even with same facial exposure sometimes it gives error as Face not detected. Same with fingerprint too. Sometimes you need to press so hard multiple times. Real real issue at times of emergency. I love my iPhone 14 for the facial Recognition feature.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Samsung s22 is the champ and maybe also called as android of iPhone. It literally seems to be powerhouse while during multitasking and also while gaming. It will only throttle when it gets hot. Camera is also good and gives good quality images and also night mode is good 👍. If you want a one hand compact phone and also want beast performance while doing gaming. Then you can go for this phone. Only con in this phone is the battery. It's 3700 and I need to charge twice a day as my usage. So buy before you do your research on this phone.\n",

Inbuilt health manager. 9. 4 years OS update and 5 years security update for both A 34 and A 54.  10. Last but not the least is the Brand Name of Samsung and respect u received while using it which is not in others Chinese brand  Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

Best for multimedia usage because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage. * Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort here and there. * Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image quality certainly increases to an extent. But overall average. * Design is good but the phone feels a bit heavier. * One ui has a lot of interesting features. # Overall a good phone worth around 25k.\n",

This phone costs a fifth of the S23 Ultra, but has almost 80% to 90% of the flagship functionality. Full HD+ OLED screen, 120hz refresh rate, expandable storage, 8GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage, a very decent camera with OIS, IP67 water resistance, and the same design as the flagship S23/S24. And the Dimensity 1080 is good enough for the majority of every day tasks, including light gaming on CODM, and an amazing battery life. Overall, can't recommend this phone enough.\n",

You have to use third part apps. - Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface. - no inbox adapter or at least a case for better protection. - OIS will destroy youe video capturing experiance. It is having fault. Now I am not able to make stable videos in stedy mode. Even you hole the phone still the video is shaking because ois is damaged.  I will drop my review again in 7 days.

      "Rating: 5, Review: The product is good. Display is awesome. Camera is also good for the price. Battery could be improved. 5000mAh seems less for the phone. Power pack performance. Overall value for money.  Used Flipkart exchange, it worked like charm and exchange was very smooth.  This is not flagship phone, do not expect the flagship feature.  Advantage over OnePlus is this is Samsung is reliable and service centre is experinced.  Only bad thing is they are stupidly following stupid Apple and removing charger from box. Whereas Chinese phone maker are giving 100watt charger withe box with silicon case.\n",

I would recommend this phone to users who want great cameras with immersive multimedia experience Its not made for hardcore gaming.\n",

Working like a brand new. 2. Unbeatable camera at this price, even some people ask are these pictures clicked from DSLR. Telephoto lens is capturing great pictures even in low light. 3. Good quality of display. 4. Feels premium as it's very sleek and light weight. 5. Fast charging, charges the phone in 1 hour 10 minutes. 6. Ram management is amazing.  Cons. (If you're not a normal user) 1. Battery gives screen on time of 5-6 hours. Use Power Saving for SOT of 6.5-7 hours. 2. Do switch to power saving mode at night before sleeping. My phone goes 13% to 0% while not on power saving mode at night. 3. Performance is not like Snapdragon but it's more than enough for daily task and for playing normal games.  Being a normal user I can assure you that you're not going to regret buying this.\n",

Lavender color was my last choice but other options were out of stock so had to go with it. But believe me this color is the best of all.  Even back is plastic it doesn't look cheap.  My verdict. Camera : 5 Display : 5 Battery : 3.5 Performance : 4.5 Build : 4.5  Bonus: You get water and dust resistance along with wireless charging which is absent in this range.  Conclusion: if your priority is not gaming and battery life then this device is for you.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The camera is one of its shining features, capturing high-quality images that are sharp, vibrant, and full of detail. Whether you're snapping a quick photo or recording a video, the camera performs exceptionally well.  The display is another strong point. It offers a clear, crisp viewing experience with excellent color reproduction. Whether you're browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the display delivers a visually pleasing experience.  However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. Despite the impressive performance of the camera and display, the battery doesn't seem to hold up as well. It drains faster than expected, which can be inconvenient for users who are frequently on the go and rely on their phone throughout the day.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using this phone as my primary phone for 4 days now. So a brief opinion I can provide about various aspects of the phone.  1. Display: Quite good, bright and nice-looking. No visibility issue in sun. Touch experience is good, the 120 hz refresh rate works fine.  2. Battery: With two sims and general office works/photo/video watch/phone call etc, it manages to last just the day-long. I unplug it ar 100 percent at 9 am, leave for office and return at 9 pm with nearly 30 percent battery remaining. It's not great, I know, but manageable. Actually samsung should come up with a faster charging capacity. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge from 0.  3. Camera: Front camera: A bit better than average, that's all. Back camera: Quite good, but again I have observed performance inconsistency. Compared to iPhone camera, there's still way to go. Colors are good, but not 100% natural.  4. Sound: No issue with clarity but lacks slightly in loudness. My 13k realme phone is louder (with clarity). But not much of an issue.  5. Call quality: Very good. No network fluctuations, no mic issue observed so far.  6. Aesthetics: Many don't really bother about this part. The positioning of power and volume keys are perfect. But the on-screen fingerprint scanner could've been better positioned. Reaching that much down is not very comfortable.  7. Performance: On regular usage I didn't find any lag. It's very smooth actually. But I'm no gamer, hence cannot comment about its gaming performance. Device is prone to getting warm, but not hot.  8. Network: I am not sure it's device issue or not, but with both my jio and Airtel sims, I often find slow data speed. My point is, upgrading from a 4G phone to a 5G one, no data speed improvement is observed.  Overall I'd say, under a 35k price tag, this phone is good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was extremely disappointed during first two to three days as the mobile was heating badly and battery life was bad and camera was not that great. I put return request as well. But from third day on wards, mobile heating issue was solved by keeping most of the apps in deep sleep mode. Battery life also improved a bit. My daily usage is office emails, teams, photo and video and extreme browsing. Battery gets drained 10% percent on 4g per 1 hour. I also capped the battery to 85% max charging to increase battery life. Charging takes one hour to become full(85%) Camera: I was using pixel4a for past two years. To say I am fan of pixel excellent computational photography. I was about to buy pixel 6a to continue my fandom but was sceptical about mobile signal issue, and lack of water proofing as i need water proofing and strong glass as my one year baby may drop the mobile accidentally or throw the mobile. So I bought this one expecting same quality of photos compare to pixel. My initial experience for first three days was not satisfactory. I couldn't get the same HDR quality pics or top class night sight photos. So I searched everywhere in internet to find gcam mode and tried many gcam mode but none was working. From third day onwards, i tried to understand the camera and editing options. Enabling motion mode made the pics blurry or s21 Fe camera is not intelligent enough to capture the best shot unlike pixel. So most of the photos were washed out due to motion mode. Now I am able to get good quality pics during good lighting conditions after disabling motion mode. And the best part of the editing feature is remaster image. When you use this option, samsung camera remaster the picture and stabilizes the image further. Also another good part of the cam is we can increase lighting for particular face when multiple people are in the picture. Results are very impressive due this as i can choose which one to be illuminated. Also i found working gcam for HDR pictures and night mode MGC by BGC. Because of this i switch to gcam when I am not satisfied with the inbuilt camera. I can confidently say after one week, i use gcam seldom. One great thing about samsung camera is pro mode. It allows me to play with many options and different lighting conditions. I came to know the camera hardware is extremely good and if you learn the pro camera, you can get super quality pictures. It's because of the software, pictures by this camera is some times fall under mid range. Video quality is excellent. Ois makes the video stable and i could capture many videos of my one year old kid and i loved the video quality. I would say it is better than pixel camera in good lighting conditions. Performance: mobile is snappy and i never saw any single occurance of slowness. It was fast and responsive. finger print is also very good, sensor is very good. Face detection is also very good and quick to respond. Display: display is bright and adaptive display is very good. Video watching in this mobile is way better than pixel. picture clarity is awesome. Victus glass is very strong, i don't have screen guard yet, my mobile fallen from three to five feet height more than ten times already but there is no single scratch on the glass. Software update: another good thing about this mobile is software update. I got latest security patch today which is way better than pixel . Samsung provides four years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. This is better than Google. Kudos to samsung for that.  Verdict: If you are looking for top class mobile with long term support, strong build quality, top class display and performance this mobile is for you. If you want flagship camera, then go for s22+. Overall i am very happy with this mobile and glad that i cancelled my return request (submitted in first two days).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic Device! Best in Segment just close your eyes and go for this🔥 being a Tech geek i heard that this phone has some crazy Heating issues and won't be surviving a full day with normal usage but even after a Heavy use(2 hours Codm,almost 10-15 mins of camera usage, Video Streaming at Highest quality+full brightness, etc) this phone easily ends with 15-20% battery left by the time it's 11:30-12AM. The main usp of this phone are its cameras and Display! I mean it's a Samsung S series phone and i guess that would be enough to tell what would be the quality of them both! Though Exynos 2100 heats up but not up to that extent which the youtubers were telling so close your eyes and go for it you will be enjoying worth every penny you will spend of this device. And Yes this device is Future proof as well i:e:- 4 Major Android Updates(till Android 16) and 5 Years of Security Patch Updates so you will not have to worry about changing your device after 1 or 2 years. Remember that the Video quality at night will be A bit grainy but the post processing will do the job after you have completed shooting the video.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: An ex-iPhone user here. Straight-up, One of the best phone cameras out there period. It takes amazing photos and the zoom is outstanding. And the display is fabulous as well, the 120hz with the Samsung's display just makes it so much better than any iphone. I compared it with the iPhone 13 and it destroys it easily.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Honest review after using it for a year..I got this beast for 31.3k in big billion day sale. It worths every single rupee..  Pros: 1) Camera clarity is awesome. 2) Feels like flagship phone. 3) Decent looks. 4) Display is extraordinary. 5) Dolby atmos is cool.  Cons: 1) Battery backup would have been even more better.   If you are getting this below 35k blindly go for it..\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera and a performance Beast! Been using it for 10 days now and here's the summary:-  PROS: -Camera__Nightography is insanely good. Beats iPhone14 and other top flagship phones by far. Portraits are a bliss for the eyes, feels like shot from DSLR. -Performance__Super smooth performance with 8 gen 1. Can handle any mobile games flawlessly. Played BGMI and Asphalt 9 and there are hardly any frame drops even after an hour. -Display__Display is too good. Peak brightness is enough and works brilliantly even during noon. Bezels are so slim it feels like holding just the screen. -Design__In hand feel is Premium. Thought the s22 would be smaller but it actually fits perfectly and probably better than the s22+. Back glass looks super Premium.  CONS -Battey__It's a big setback for this flagship Beast. Lasts 24hrs only in standby or if you pass half the time not using the phone. Barely lasts 12 hrs with a little bit of camera and ~1hr of gaming. Reason for a less star -Heating__Heats a lot while playing games or recording videos. Would suggest doing these without a back cover for better performance.  OVERALL it's a steal @39999 just for the camera and performance. I genuinely prefer only these 2 and it doesn't bother me to charge the phone a couple of times or carry a powerbank so the cons are fine by me. But if you want your phone to last for a day or prefer bigger screen/storage there are better options in this price range.  Hope this helps 😃\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact flagship phone with a beautiful design, great cameras, and fast software updates. However, its battery life is underwhelming, and it has high idle battery drain.  Pros:  Beautiful design Great camera Fast software updates Compact size  Cons:  Bad battery life High idle battery drain  Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 is a great phone, but its battery life is a major drawback. If you're looking for a compact flagship phone with a great camera and fast software updates, the S22 is a good option, but be prepared to carry a charger with you.  Here are some additional thoughts on the S22's battery life:  The S22 has a relatively small battery, at 3,700mAh. This is less than the batteries in many other flagship phones.  The S22's battery life can be especially poor if you use it for demanding tasks, such as gaming or video streaming.  S22 has high idle battery drain, meaning that it loses battery even when you're not using it actively.  If you're considering buying an S22, it's important to be aware of its battery life limitations. If you're a heavy user, or if you need your phone to last all day on a single charge, you may want to consider a different phone.  As battery backup isn't an issue for me hence giving 4 stars.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall a great deal for moderate users! Display and camera quality is just amazing. Phone is small and handy and feels premium. Only problem is battery as standby time can be less if heavy user.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I got the best phone in BBD sales and also I like him most because it has an awesome camera and performance is also superb. One disappointing thing is the battery if you use your phone continuously it takes two times a charge in a day. But overall the best phone I got\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing this device review after 15 days of using, I got this phone at 34k. This is a fully packed mobile with lots of good features and specs. Battery easily lasts for more than 5.5hrs (100% to 25-20%) in simple + moderate use (on 60hz) and also 25watt charging is superfast according to 3700 mah battery capacity. It tooks 50-60 minutes to get fully charged and in 20 minutes, it charges the device to 50% with original Samsung Charger. This phone targets simple user who are not always active on their mobile screen. Camera, Performance, Display, In-Hand feeling all are really premium. Please do update to the latest Android version for smooth experience and good battery life. During first 3-4 days, the UI will learn your usage pattern and then it will optimise the phone's battery according to your usage and i also don't feel any kind of over heating while testing it with heavy games and application, it only gets warm which is very common in every phone. If you're a heavy user or looking for good battery phone which can last upto or more than 6hrs, then go with OnePlus and IQOO. I was also looking for Nothing phone 2 but it is still a new brand so trust issues are obvious. I was looking for a handy and flat display phone with Clean UI and good features, This device really matched my requirements. ***Review after 6-7 months of usage (Using OneUI 6.1)*** This is a really nice smartphone at this price range. Charging was something for which i was feeling gutted but there is not any issue like that. From Display, Charging, Performance, Camera, Fast Charging, Compact Looks and all the major factors it is truly a worthy deal if you're getting it in between 30k to 35k (depends on Bank offer etc.). Battery is lasting for more than 6hrs 30min. from 85-80% to 25-20% in moderate usage. Many users have complaint about its heating issue, but this is not an issue. Every smartphone gets WARM during usage and while charging. There is a major difference between WARM and HEAT. So just go for it without any hesitation.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before buying this product I have heard many times that this battery doesn't lasts long even a day but wanted to buy this phone at any cost because this one problem was not a deal breaker and I love Samsung phones especially their display design and camera. But believe me after buying this phone even though I got less screen time but after using 2 to 3 weeks the phone gets adapt to the usage and gets optimized and I have easily got about 4.5 to 5 hours easily and I am a moderate user casual games, video streaming, social media and lot of phone calls. Don't revert your decision hearing from people about it's battery believe me it's worth it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall the performance of the mobile is excellent. Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact high end device with every feature integrated inside it. I fell the draw back of the mobile is the battery. You have to charge your mobile two time in a day if you are using it excessively.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The Samsung S22 is a phone that has some great features, but also some significant drawbacks. One of the biggest issues with this phone is its battery life. The battery drains quickly, even with normal use, and it can be frustrating to constantly have to charge the phone throughout the day. This is definitely a disadvantage for users who are always on-the-go and need a phone that can keep up with their busy lifestyle.  However, the Samsung S22 also has some standout features that make it a worthwhile purchase for some users. The display on this phone is fantastic, with crisp and vibrant colors that really pop. Whether you're watching videos, browsing the internet, or playing games, the display is sure to impress.  Another area where the Samsung S22 excels is in its performance. The phone is equipped with a powerful Snapdragon processor that delivers fast and smooth performance for all your daily tasks. Whether you're multitasking between apps or running demanding games, the Samsung S22 can handle it all with ease.  Overall, the Samsung S22 is a phone that has its ups and downs. While the battery life can be frustrating, the display and performance are both excellent. If you prioritize a great display and fast performance over battery life, then the Samsung S22 may be the perfect phone for you.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Before I proceed with the review, let me tell you that this is going to be my secondary device. My primary device is still an iPhone. As a secondary device, this is an all-round good phone.  Here are some of my initial impressions-  1. Good display with adequate outdoor brightness. 2. Compact size- this is one of the best features of this phone. 3. Good set of cameras. 4. Some useful features like Samsung Pay, DeX mode comes handy at times. 5. Performance is good- no major lag while casually using the device. 6. Heating is there, but it's manageable. 7. Speakers are decent. 8. Fingerprint scanner is somewhat good. If you have really dry hands (which some of us have during winters), then fingerprint scanner becomes unreliable at times. 9. Battery is decent. If you casually use this device, then the device will last for a typical working day. If you're a medium or heavy user, then please be prepared to carry a power-bank with you. 10. Build quality is good.  To conclude, I would say, if you're getting this device under 40K, and you're in market for a compact device, then go for this one. Remember, this phone is not meant for heavy usage. And as a secondary device, this serves the purpose well.\n",

In case of this full credit goes to Flipkart ...they are charging. 40 rupees for secure packing .but till now I couldn't find out what safety was there ... same old package of Flipkart with out any changes no any airbubles protection nothing just the paper box ..and we are paying extra rupees for this same packing. @flipkart requesting your team to add any special secure package for fragile things and charge the money. Just for the old package please don't charge any extras. If the secure package was ok then also I would have rated as 5.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using S22 for 1 month now .S22 is Good works well everything is perfect expect Battery backup (specificly if you use 120 hz then it will last for 4 hours in light uses.If you use battery saver then S22 will give upto 6 hours according to your use). Don't expect to do gaming on this phone because of battery and heat ya you can play light games . S22 camera is fabulious just amezing its the best camera phone under 40k even s22 camera beats i phone 13. If you are looking for compact phone and you are not heavy user just casual then go for it. If you are someone who only sticks to the phone all day long then you have to charge it 3 times a day . Its not a big deal for me i am not heavy user it easily last all day for me . And ya if you use camera more then phone will heat and as a result battery will drain . And remeber this phone is not for gaming.\n",

It will only throttle when it gets hot. Camera is also good and gives good quality images and also night mode is good 👍. If you want a one hand compact phone and also want beast performance while doing gaming. Then you can go for this phone. Only con in this phone is the battery. It's 3700 and I need to charge twice a day as my usage. So buy before you do your research on this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: This device is not a value for money. It has inbuilt over heating issue even when it is used for very short time. Both Samsung and Flipkart are not taking any responsibility for this. My mobile is in use for only two days (without installing any app) and it is heating upto 44 degree Celsius that too in Air-conditioned (AC) room of Samsung Service Centre itself and Samsung services centre people saying that it is normal. It is very disappointing to purchase such flagship mobile and flipkart delivered faulty device and both Samsung and flipkart are not taking any responsibility for this and not providing replacement for this faulty mobile. It is very disappointing.\n",

Network is an issue, I've used multiple sims at different locations and found that it's the phone. Other phones are doing great in this term. Major thing is this phone heats... it's in red hot form whenever you'll use it for multitasking more than half an hour. In this summer time it's too hot to use. Even using rubber backcase you will feel the heat. And scree is also hot.  If you are Samsung interface lover and wants Samsung only like me... then you should go with S21FE in same budget.\n",

Inbuilt health manager. 9. 4 years OS update and 5 years security update for both A 34 and A 54.  10. Last but not the least is the Brand Name of Samsung and respect u received while using it which is not in others Chinese brand  Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

But in low light aur day time it's very good considering the comparison with other phones under 25k. Edge ditaction is good but needs more improvement.  IP 67 Rating is plus fr this phone.  It's very light without back cover, easy to hold and feels good and premium even with plastic back.  Looks of phone -5/5  Performance- 4.5/5 Smooth (I am not a gamer)  Screen- 5/5 Premium amoled better than other Chinese phone.  My previous phone was realms 9 pro+ .

Best for multimedia usage because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage. * Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort here and there. * Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image quality certainly increases to an extent. But overall average. * Design is good but the phone feels a bit heavier. * One ui has a lot of interesting features. # Overall a good phone worth around 25k.\n",

This phone costs a fifth of the S23 Ultra, but has almost 80% to 90% of the flagship functionality. Full HD+ OLED screen, 120hz refresh rate, expandable storage, 8GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage, a very decent camera with OIS, IP67 water resistance, and the same design as the flagship S23/S24. And the Dimensity 1080 is good enough for the majority of every day tasks, including light gaming on CODM, and an amazing battery life. Overall, can't recommend this phone enough.\n",

You have to use third part apps. - Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface. - no inbox adapter or at least a case for better protection. - OIS will destroy youe video capturing experiance. It is having fault. Now I am not able to make stable videos in stedy mode. Even you hole the phone still the video is shaking because ois is damaged.  I will drop my review again in 7 days.

Overall value for money.  Used Flipkart exchange, it worked like charm and exchange was very smooth.  This is not flagship phone, do not expect the flagship feature.  Advantage over OnePlus is this is Samsung is reliable and service centre is experinced.  Only bad thing is they are stupidly following stupid Apple and removing charger from box. Whereas Chinese phone maker are giving 100watt charger withe box with silicon case.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: PHONE is good. Looks superb and beautiful. Good buy I have seen many videos of proc and cons but according to me the best part in this phone are  1. Elegant look. It's body is of plastic but very premium quality, back part is amazing with camera part looks like S23 2. Excellent Display. 3. 4K video recording. 4. Good battery. I bought portronics adapter for Rs 450. 5. Waterproof in this range. 6. Speaker output is amazing and gives good sounds and effect. Also has equalizer. 7. Split screen as multimedia enhancement. 8. Inbuilt health manager. 9. 4 years OS update and 5 years security update for both A 34 and A 54.  10. Last but not the least is the Brand Name of Samsung and respect u received while using it which is not in others Chinese brand  Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

Details coming inside the photos are natural. 2. Battery backup is decent I would say not that much good but it's giving you good Battery backup. Also if you're using in power saving mood Battery draining is very low. 3. Charging time is good. 4. When I played BGMI on this phone there is no lag and also we can play smooth graphics with extreme frame rate and running good. 5. Design of the phone is great personally I love the Design of the phone. Personally I'll recommend to buy this phone without any hesitation.\n",

But in low light aur day time it's very good considering the comparison with other phones under 25k. Edge ditaction is good but needs more improvement.  IP 67 Rating is plus fr this phone.  It's very light without back cover, easy to hold and feels good and premium even with plastic back.  Looks of phone -5/5  Performance- 4.5/5 Smooth (I am not a gamer)  Screen- 5/5 Premium amoled better than other Chinese phone.  My previous phone was realms 9 pro+ . So you can judge my review on the basis of that. The camera in Samsung a34 is at least 2 times better than realme 9 pro + even that had Sony imx.  Overall 4.5 🌟 out of 5\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using for a month * Display is the best * Speakers are too good. Best for multimedia usage because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage. * Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort here and there. * Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image quality certainly increases to an extent. But overall average. * Design is good but the phone feels a bit heavier. * One ui has a lot of interesting features. # Overall a good phone worth around 25k.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The A34 proves that for the overwhelming majority of people, the flagship devices are a criminal waste of money. This phone costs a fifth of the S23 Ultra, but has almost 80% to 90% of the flagship functionality. Full HD+ OLED screen, 120hz refresh rate, expandable storage, 8GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage, a very decent camera with OIS, IP67 water resistance, and the same design as the flagship S23/S24. And the Dimensity 1080 is good enough for the majority of every day tasks, including light gaming on CODM, and an amazing battery life. Overall, can't recommend this phone enough.\n",

You have to use third part apps. - Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface. - no inbox adapter or at least a case for better protection. - OIS will destroy youe video capturing experiance. It is having fault. Now I am not able to make stable videos in stedy mode. Even you hole the phone still the video is shaking because ois is damaged.  I will drop my review again in 7 days.

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been 3-4 months using this phone. [UPDATED]  Pros. 1. I've bought 128GB variant out of that 128GB, 122GB is occupied by Apps, Videos, Photos etc... still 0% lagg. Working like a brand new. 2. Unbeatable camera at this price, even some people ask are these pictures clicked from DSLR. Telephoto lens is capturing great pictures even in low light. 3. Good quality of display. 4. Feels premium as it's very sleek and light weight. 5. Fast charging, charges the phone in 1 hour 10 minutes. 6. Ram management is amazing.  Cons. (If you're not a normal user) 1. Battery gives screen on time of 5-6 hours. Use Power Saving for SOT of 6.5-7 hours. 2. Do switch to power saving mode at night before sleeping. My phone goes 13% to 0% while not on power saving mode at night. 3. Performance is not like Snapdragon but it's more than enough for daily task and for playing normal games.  Being a normal user I can assure you that you're not going to regret buying this.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I was looking at this phone before BBD and it was at the lowest price at that time, I didn't get it at lowest price but lower price of 33k and even at this price this device worth a lot.  Lavender color was my last choice but other options were out of stock so had to go with it. But believe me this color is the best of all.  Even back is plastic it doesn't look cheap.  My verdict. Camera : 5 Display : 5 Battery : 3.5 Performance : 4.5 Build : 4.5  Bonus: You get water and dust resistance along with wireless charging which is absent in this range.  Conclusion: if your priority is not gaming and battery life then this device is for you.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The camera is one of its shining features, capturing high-quality images that are sharp, vibrant, and full of detail. Whether you're snapping a quick photo or recording a video, the camera performs exceptionally well.  The display is another strong point. It offers a clear, crisp viewing experience with excellent color reproduction. Whether you're browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the display delivers a visually pleasing experience.  However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. Despite the impressive performance of the camera and display, the battery doesn't seem to hold up as well. It drains faster than expected, which can be inconvenient for users who are frequently on the go and rely on their phone throughout the day.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using this phone as my primary phone for 4 days now. So a brief opinion I can provide about various aspects of the phone.  1. Display: Quite good, bright and nice-looking. No visibility issue in sun. Touch experience is good, the 120 hz refresh rate works fine.  2. Battery: With two sims and general office works/photo/video watch/phone call etc, it manages to last just the day-long. I unplug it ar 100 percent at 9 am, leave for office and return at 9 pm with nearly 30 percent battery remaining. It's not great, I know, but manageable. Actually samsung should come up with a faster charging capacity. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge from 0.  3. Camera: Front camera: A bit better than average, that's all. Back camera: Quite good, but again I have observed performance inconsistency. Compared to iPhone camera, there's still way to go. Colors are good, but not 100% natural.  4. Sound: No issue with clarity but lacks slightly in loudness. My 13k realme phone is louder (with clarity). But not much of an issue.  5. Call quality: Very good. No network fluctuations, no mic issue observed so far.  6. Aesthetics: Many don't really bother about this part. The positioning of power and volume keys are perfect. But the on-screen fingerprint scanner could've been better positioned. Reaching that much down is not very comfortable.  7. Performance: On regular usage I didn't find any lag. It's very smooth actually. But I'm no gamer, hence cannot comment about its gaming performance. Device is prone to getting warm, but not hot.  8. Network: I am not sure it's device issue or not, but with both my jio and Airtel sims, I often find slow data speed. My point is, upgrading from a 4G phone to a 5G one, no data speed improvement is observed.  Overall I'd say, under a 35k price tag, this phone is good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was extremely disappointed during first two to three days as the mobile was heating badly and battery life was bad and camera was not that great. I put return request as well. But from third day on wards, mobile heating issue was solved by keeping most of the apps in deep sleep mode. Battery life also improved a bit. My daily usage is office emails, teams, photo and video and extreme browsing. Battery gets drained 10% percent on 4g per 1 hour. I also capped the battery to 85% max charging to increase battery life. Charging takes one hour to become full(85%) Camera: I was using pixel4a for past two years. To say I am fan of pixel excellent computational photography. I was about to buy pixel 6a to continue my fandom but was sceptical about mobile signal issue, and lack of water proofing as i need water proofing and strong glass as my one year baby may drop the mobile accidentally or throw the mobile. So I bought this one expecting same quality of photos compare to pixel. My initial experience for first three days was not satisfactory. I couldn't get the same HDR quality pics or top class night sight photos. So I searched everywhere in internet to find gcam mode and tried many gcam mode but none was working. From third day onwards, i tried to understand the camera and editing options. Enabling motion mode made the pics blurry or s21 Fe camera is not intelligent enough to capture the best shot unlike pixel. So most of the photos were washed out due to motion mode. Now I am able to get good quality pics during good lighting conditions after disabling motion mode. And the best part of the editing feature is remaster image. When you use this option, samsung camera remaster the picture and stabilizes the image further. Also another good part of the cam is we can increase lighting for particular face when multiple people are in the picture. Results are very impressive due this as i can choose which one to be illuminated. Also i found working gcam for HDR pictures and night mode MGC by BGC. Because of this i switch to gcam when I am not satisfied with the inbuilt camera. I can confidently say after one week, i use gcam seldom. One great thing about samsung camera is pro mode. It allows me to play with many options and different lighting conditions. I came to know the camera hardware is extremely good and if you learn the pro camera, you can get super quality pictures. It's because of the software, pictures by this camera is some times fall under mid range. Video quality is excellent. Ois makes the video stable and i could capture many videos of my one year old kid and i loved the video quality. I would say it is better than pixel camera in good lighting conditions. Performance: mobile is snappy and i never saw any single occurance of slowness. It was fast and responsive. finger print is also very good, sensor is very good. Face detection is also very good and quick to respond. Display: display is bright and adaptive display is very good. Video watching in this mobile is way better than pixel. picture clarity is awesome. Victus glass is very strong, i don't have screen guard yet, my mobile fallen from three to five feet height more than ten times already but there is no single scratch on the glass. Software update: another good thing about this mobile is software update. I got latest security patch today which is way better than pixel . Samsung provides four years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. This is better than Google. Kudos to samsung for that.  Verdict: If you are looking for top class mobile with long term support, strong build quality, top class display and performance this mobile is for you. If you want flagship camera, then go for s22+. Overall i am very happy with this mobile and glad that i cancelled my return request (submitted in first two days).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic Device! Best in Segment just close your eyes and go for this🔥 being a Tech geek i heard that this phone has some crazy Heating issues and won't be surviving a full day with normal usage but even after a Heavy use(2 hours Codm,almost 10-15 mins of camera usage, Video Streaming at Highest quality+full brightness, etc) this phone easily ends with 15-20% battery left by the time it's 11:30-12AM. The main usp of this phone are its cameras and Display! I mean it's a Samsung S series phone and i guess that would be enough to tell what would be the quality of them both! Though Exynos 2100 heats up but not up to that extent which the youtubers were telling so close your eyes and go for it you will be enjoying worth every penny you will spend of this device. And Yes this device is Future proof as well i:e:- 4 Major Android Updates(till Android 16) and 5 Years of Security Patch Updates so you will not have to worry about changing your device after 1 or 2 years. Remember that the Video quality at night will be A bit grainy but the post processing will do the job after you have completed shooting the video.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The A34 proves that for the overwhelming majority of people, the flagship devices are a criminal waste of money. This phone costs a fifth of the S23 Ultra, but has almost 80% to 90% of the flagship functionality. Full HD+ OLED screen, 120hz refresh rate, expandable storage, 8GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage, a very decent camera with OIS, IP67 water resistance, and the same design as the flagship S23/S24. And the Dimensity 1080 is good enough for the majority of every day tasks, including light gaming on CODM, and an amazing battery life. Overall, can't recommend this phone enough.\n",

You have to use third part apps. - Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface. - no inbox adapter or at least a case for better protection. - OIS will destroy youe video capturing experiance. It is having fault. Now I am not able to make stable videos in stedy mode. Even you hole the phone still the video is shaking because ois is damaged.  I will drop my review again in 7 days.

I bought portronics adapter for Rs 450. 5. Waterproof in this range. 6. Speaker output is amazing and gives good sounds and effect. Also has equalizer. 7. Split screen as multimedia enhancement. 8. Inbuilt health manager. 9. 4 years OS update and 5 years security update for both A 34 and A 54.  10. Last but not the least is the Brand Name of Samsung and respect u received while using it which is not in others Chinese brand  Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

Details coming inside the photos are natural. 2. Battery backup is decent I would say not that much good but it's giving you good Battery backup. Also if you're using in power saving mood Battery draining is very low. 3. Charging time is good. 4. When I played BGMI on this phone there is no lag and also we can play smooth graphics with extreme frame rate and running good. 5. Design of the phone is great personally I love the Design of the phone. Personally I'll recommend to buy this phone without any hesitation.\n",

But in low light aur day time it's very good considering the comparison with other phones under 25k. Edge ditaction is good but needs more improvement.  IP 67 Rating is plus fr this phone.  It's very light without back cover, easy to hold and feels good and premium even with plastic back.  Looks of phone -5/5  Performance- 4.5/5 Smooth (I am not a gamer)  Screen- 5/5 Premium amoled better than other Chinese phone.  My previous phone was realms 9 pro+ . So you can judge my review on the basis of that. The camera in Samsung a34 is at least 2 times better than realme 9 pro + even that had Sony imx.  Overall 4.5 🌟 out of 5\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using for a month * Display is the best * Speakers are too good. Best for multimedia usage because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage. * Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort here and there. * Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image quality certainly increases to an extent. But overall average. * Design is good but the phone feels a bit heavier. * One ui has a lot of interesting features. # Overall a good phone worth around 25k.\n",

The designe is also really good simple and elegant Sound from the stereo speakers are really loud and crisp and and the display is one of the the best in the segment My only concern is the battery though i am not a heavy user, i hardly play any games still the phone barely makes it through the day when fully charged U can expect screen on time of about 5 and half hrs from this phone. I would recommend this phone to users who want great cameras with immersive multimedia experience Its not made for hardcore gaming.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been 3-4 months using this phone. [UPDATED]  Pros. 1. I've bought 128GB variant out of that 128GB, 122GB is occupied by Apps, Videos, Photos etc... still 0% lagg. Working like a brand new. 2. Unbeatable camera at this price, even some people ask are these pictures clicked from DSLR. Telephoto lens is capturing great pictures even in low light. 3. Good quality of display. 4. Feels premium as it's very sleek and light weight. 5. Fast charging, charges the phone in 1 hour 10 minutes. 6. Ram management is amazing.  Cons. (If you're not a normal user) 1. Battery gives screen on time of 5-6 hours. Use Power Saving for SOT of 6.5-7 hours. 2. Do switch to power saving mode at night before sleeping. My phone goes 13% to 0% while not on power saving mode at night. 3. Performance is not like Snapdragon but it's more than enough for daily task and for playing normal games.  Being a normal user I can assure you that you're not going to regret buying this.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I was looking at this phone before BBD and it was at the lowest price at that time, I didn't get it at lowest price but lower price of 33k and even at this price this device worth a lot.  Lavender color was my last choice but other options were out of stock so had to go with it. But believe me this color is the best of all.  Even back is plastic it doesn't look cheap.  My verdict. Camera : 5 Display : 5 Battery : 3.5 Performance : 4.5 Build : 4.5  Bonus: You get water and dust resistance along with wireless charging which is absent in this range.  Conclusion: if your priority is not gaming and battery life then this device is for you.\n",

Camera, display, performance, design, signal reception, speakers everything is good.  But at this price point this is one of the value for money mobiles.  One of the biggest advantage is Samsung is promising 4 years of Android updates, this device will get updates all the way to Android 16.  Overall, I am satisfied with the device apart from battery.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Trust me Its Camera and display is far better than my iphone 13. Amazing Low light photography with so many inbuilt effects. Object removal feature works perfectly.

      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall good phone but battery 🔋 backup in decent. Camera 📷 is awesome.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The camera is one of its shining features, capturing high-quality images that are sharp, vibrant, and full of detail. Whether you're snapping a quick photo or recording a video, the camera performs exceptionally well.  The display is another strong point. It offers a clear, crisp viewing experience with excellent color reproduction. Whether you're browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the display delivers a visually pleasing experience.  However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. Despite the impressive performance of the camera and display, the battery doesn't seem to hold up as well. It drains faster than expected, which can be inconvenient for users who are frequently on the go and rely on their phone throughout the day.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using this phone as my primary phone for 4 days now. So a brief opinion I can provide about various aspects of the phone.  1. Display: Quite good, bright and nice-looking. No visibility issue in sun. Touch experience is good, the 120 hz refresh rate works fine.  2. Battery: With two sims and general office works/photo/video watch/phone call etc, it manages to last just the day-long. I unplug it ar 100 percent at 9 am, leave for office and return at 9 pm with nearly 30 percent battery remaining. It's not great, I know, but manageable. Actually samsung should come up with a faster charging capacity. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge from 0.  3. Camera: Front camera: A bit better than average, that's all. Back camera: Quite good, but again I have observed performance inconsistency. Compared to iPhone camera, there's still way to go. Colors are good, but not 100% natural.  4. Sound: No issue with clarity but lacks slightly in loudness. My 13k realme phone is louder (with clarity). But not much of an issue.  5. Call quality: Very good. No network fluctuations, no mic issue observed so far.  6. Aesthetics: Many don't really bother about this part. The positioning of power and volume keys are perfect. But the on-screen fingerprint scanner could've been better positioned. Reaching that much down is not very comfortable.  7. Performance: On regular usage I didn't find any lag. It's very smooth actually. But I'm no gamer, hence cannot comment about its gaming performance. Device is prone to getting warm, but not hot.  8. Network: I am not sure it's device issue or not, but with both my jio and Airtel sims, I often find slow data speed. My point is, upgrading from a 4G phone to a 5G one, no data speed improvement is observed.  Overall I'd say, under a 35k price tag, this phone is good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was extremely disappointed during first two to three days as the mobile was heating badly and battery life was bad and camera was not that great. I put return request as well. But from third day on wards, mobile heating issue was solved by keeping most of the apps in deep sleep mode. Battery life also improved a bit. My daily usage is office emails, teams, photo and video and extreme browsing. Battery gets drained 10% percent on 4g per 1 hour. I also capped the battery to 85% max charging to increase battery life. Charging takes one hour to become full(85%) Camera: I was using pixel4a for past two years. To say I am fan of pixel excellent computational photography. I was about to buy pixel 6a to continue my fandom but was sceptical about mobile signal issue, and lack of water proofing as i need water proofing and strong glass as my one year baby may drop the mobile accidentally or throw the mobile. So I bought this one expecting same quality of photos compare to pixel. My initial experience for first three days was not satisfactory. I couldn't get the same HDR quality pics or top class night sight photos. So I searched everywhere in internet to find gcam mode and tried many gcam mode but none was working. From third day onwards, i tried to understand the camera and editing options. Enabling motion mode made the pics blurry or s21 Fe camera is not intelligent enough to capture the best shot unlike pixel. So most of the photos were washed out due to motion mode. Now I am able to get good quality pics during good lighting conditions after disabling motion mode. And the best part of the editing feature is remaster image. When you use this option, samsung camera remaster the picture and stabilizes the image further. Also another good part of the cam is we can increase lighting for particular face when multiple people are in the picture. Results are very impressive due this as i can choose which one to be illuminated. Also i found working gcam for HDR pictures and night mode MGC by BGC. Because of this i switch to gcam when I am not satisfied with the inbuilt camera. I can confidently say after one week, i use gcam seldom. One great thing about samsung camera is pro mode. It allows me to play with many options and different lighting conditions. I came to know the camera hardware is extremely good and if you learn the pro camera, you can get super quality pictures. It's because of the software, pictures by this camera is some times fall under mid range. Video quality is excellent. Ois makes the video stable and i could capture many videos of my one year old kid and i loved the video quality. I would say it is better than pixel camera in good lighting conditions. Performance: mobile is snappy and i never saw any single occurance of slowness. It was fast and responsive. finger print is also very good, sensor is very good. Face detection is also very good and quick to respond. Display: display is bright and adaptive display is very good. Video watching in this mobile is way better than pixel. picture clarity is awesome. Victus glass is very strong, i don't have screen guard yet, my mobile fallen from three to five feet height more than ten times already but there is no single scratch on the glass. Software update: another good thing about this mobile is software update. I got latest security patch today which is way better than pixel . Samsung provides four years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. This is better than Google. Kudos to samsung for that.  Verdict: If you are looking for top class mobile with long term support, strong build quality, top class display and performance this mobile is for you. If you want flagship camera, then go for s22+. Overall i am very happy with this mobile and glad that i cancelled my return request (submitted in first two days).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic Device! Best in Segment just close your eyes and go for this🔥 being a Tech geek i heard that this phone has some crazy Heating issues and won't be surviving a full day with normal usage but even after a Heavy use(2 hours Codm,almost 10-15 mins of camera usage, Video Streaming at Highest quality+full brightness, etc) this phone easily ends with 15-20% battery left by the time it's 11:30-12AM. The main usp of this phone are its cameras and Display! I mean it's a Samsung S series phone and i guess that would be enough to tell what would be the quality of them both! Though Exynos 2100 heats up but not up to that extent which the youtubers were telling so close your eyes and go for it you will be enjoying worth every penny you will spend of this device. And Yes this device is Future proof as well i:e:- 4 Major Android Updates(till Android 16) and 5 Years of Security Patch Updates so you will not have to worry about changing your device after 1 or 2 years. Remember that the Video quality at night will be A bit grainy but the post processing will do the job after you have completed shooting the video.\n",

Inbuilt health manager. 9. 4 years OS update and 5 years security update for both A 34 and A 54.  10. Last but not the least is the Brand Name of Samsung and respect u received while using it which is not in others Chinese brand  Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: One day usage review-  Battery - 5/5 You can use it for whole day.  Camera- 4/5 Captures good quality in image in decent light too. But in dark it struggle. But in low light aur day time it's very good considering the comparison with other phones under 25k. Edge ditaction is good but needs more improvement.  IP 67 Rating is plus fr this phone.  It's very light without back cover, easy to hold and feels good and premium even with plastic back.  Looks of phone -5/5  Performance- 4.5/5 Smooth (I am not a gamer)  Screen- 5/5 Premium amoled better than other Chinese phone.  My previous phone was realms 9 pro+ . So you can judge my review on the basis of that. The camera in Samsung a34 is at least 2 times better than realme 9 pro + even that had Sony imx.  Overall 4.5 🌟 out of 5\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using for a month * Display is the best * Speakers are too good. Best for multimedia usage because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage. * Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort here and there. * Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image quality certainly increases to an extent. But overall average. * Design is good but the phone feels a bit heavier. * One ui has a lot of interesting features. # Overall a good phone worth around 25k.\n",

Reason behind to buy the product is security KNOX.. and premium software experience.  Camera is good enough for natural photos. Charging speed is low, but battery backup is better than Chinese Brand which give fast charging. Samsung Wallet LOOOVVEEE that .. securely payment option tap or scan..

      "Rating: 4, Review: Previously, I was Using Galaxy A50s. I have purchased Now Galaxy A34 5G 8Gb + 256 Gb Balck Colour Varient. My overall Review:- Camera :- Not as per my Expectations. Battery :- Well Balanced. Display :- Best Quality but max resolution is 2160 P. Performance :- Till Now, Well Performance compared to samsung exynos. Design :- Fantastic In Black Colour. Price :- Somewhat Over-Priced.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Camera quality awesome\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The A34 proves that for the overwhelming majority of people, the flagship devices are a criminal waste of money. This phone costs a fifth of the S23 Ultra, but has almost 80% to 90% of the flagship functionality. Full HD+ OLED screen, 120hz refresh rate, expandable storage, 8GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage, a very decent camera with OIS, IP67 water resistance, and the same design as the flagship S23/S24. And the Dimensity 1080 is good enough for the majority of every day tasks, including light gaming on CODM, and an amazing battery life. Overall, can't recommend this phone enough.\n",

Here is my 1.5 month use review  Pros - Display - Photo (but you need to make proper settinging) - Premium design and built - Battery seems good to my kind of use  Cons - Price is little high, keeping it around 22-25k would be great. - samsung is not giving any features with the switch app to get backup restored from other android devices except samsung and ios. You have to use third part apps. - Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface. - no inbox adapter or at least a case for better protection. - OIS will destroy youe video capturing experiance. It is having fault. Now I am not able to make stable videos in stedy mode. Even you hole the phone still the video is shaking because ois is damaged.  I will drop my review again in 7 days.

Overall value for money.  Used Flipkart exchange, it worked like charm and exchange was very smooth.  This is not flagship phone, do not expect the flagship feature.  Advantage over OnePlus is this is Samsung is reliable and service centre is experinced.  Only bad thing is they are stupidly following stupid Apple and removing charger from box. Whereas Chinese phone maker are giving 100watt charger withe box with silicon case.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I wanted to buy Samsung so I am not doing comparison from other phone, I decided that's it. - Touch is very responsive and the best, silk touch I would say very precise and smooth. - Camera is good, as expected not bad, not poor. It's old habit of Samsung that low light images looks like AI edited. Daylight is good as Samsung does and as expected from 25 mp - Sound / display is good. - Battery is good, actually when phone gets more features and good display then your 4000 mah will work 3000 mah, similarly if you get 5000mah based on phone the based on features that will work to as 3000 mah. (3000 mah means, a day long battery). I am not talking about some local phones. Every branded phone has battery for a day long and a day+ long battery.  Key Point*** - Samsung One UI is far better than any other android UI. I have used stock UI on earlier android One phones. So I can says it's close. Many features are better and couple features could be better.  Now why I have given 4 star rating*** - Finger print scanner at unlock screen, is bit slow and some times do miss, so you have to put thumb again. Though, there are other ways, like keep smart lock on etc .. and expecting that in coming updates Samsung will resolve this issue. So conclusion is you can Live with it and it should not be deal breaker.  One more point to remember: Always go for bit higher RAM like 6 GB at least for 9.0 pie based OS. Though, you have heard some people say that RAM doesn't matter it's just a show of and it's matter of tuning with CPU and other hardware in phone. It's not 100% true. I am experienced Software person and very well understand, how RAM plays a role, so higher Ram is always better. In today's case 6gb should be present in any android based phone (9.0 pie+).   UPDATE after 5 Month of usages: - UI is awesome, very intellectually designed.  Problem: - Network signal problem if network strength is little low, it will give you almost no signal and problem in talking and accessing data. - Also, You can not use dual sim, phone gets very slow. - After update, unlock finger print unlock is bit better but issue not completely resolved. Still you can find bit slow and some misses the match and you have put finger again.\n",

When download any web series overheating is too much. 4G video call (In dialer)when make automatic its going down on 3G network. Figure scanner not working properly that by I'm not registered finger security. pubg game is smooth play but sometimes it's become hang or battery drain very fast. Processer is not powerful compare to mid range processors.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic phone at this price. Was blown out specially with the display and wide angle camera. I was able to play PUBG at HDR - ULTRA settings easily. RAM Management is also good. Pubg kept running in the background. Edge detection and camera quality is superb. One downside is the low light photography. It sucks. Battery backup is quiet good too. I will say must go over Redmi Note 7 Pro\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is one of the best phone ever produced by Samsung for the mid range. Camera quality is good but low light pic is not that good. Redmi note 7 pro picture beats it in low light picture. video quality is very good but super slow motion is not present. Ar imogi feature is super cool. As it has S10 interface a lot of feature in camera and overall phone. processor is good. I am a heavy user of the phone but did not feel any lag in it. Display is super cool. As I am a movie lover I felt the difference. Super amoled display gives you the unbeatable experience.  Battery is moderate. For a heavy user like me it gives 24 hour back up. but though it has fast charging it takes 2 hours to charge fully. which is irritating.  In display fingerprint is really inaccurate and boring though after software update it is improved a little Samsung have to work a lot on it.  Overall experience is good. You can surely go for it. I am using Samsung phone for the first time and I'M quite satisfied.\n",

Display is toooooo good and processing speed is also fine for the cost . now for pubg users it is good and you will get battery more than 9 hours for playing pubg .\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Very good display, decent battery back up with dual SIMs, light weight, loved the white colour. As everyone say finger print scanner is really a disappointment for me as well. Stopped using it & relying on face detection & pattern. One UI comes with a lot of useful features. Camera is quite impressive. Very good phone for media consumption...All in all a decent midrange phone with almost everything right except fingerprint scanner...found it more value for money & practical than A70.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Changing my decision after 4 months of usage , during initial days of usage i thought mobile was not up to mark for its performance, battery life, and camera clarity for its price range.  After days of usage and constant OTA updates the performance and camera stability, and battery backup has been improved a lot.  The only cons is its fingerprint sensor which is very slow and not responsive sometimes.  Overall the performance of phone and battery backup is good.  Only thing i like in the phone is immersive display quality will put a different kind of experience while watching HD videos\n",

I would recommend this phone to users who want great cameras with immersive multimedia experience Its not made for hardcore gaming.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been 3-4 months using this phone. [UPDATED]  Pros. 1. I've bought 128GB variant out of that 128GB, 122GB is occupied by Apps, Videos, Photos etc... still 0% lagg. Working like a brand new. 2. Unbeatable camera at this price, even some people ask are these pictures clicked from DSLR. Telephoto lens is capturing great pictures even in low light. 3. Good quality of display. 4. Feels premium as it's very sleek and light weight. 5. Fast charging, charges the phone in 1 hour 10 minutes. 6. Ram management is amazing.  Cons. (If you're not a normal user) 1. Battery gives screen on time of 5-6 hours. Use Power Saving for SOT of 6.5-7 hours. 2. Do switch to power saving mode at night before sleeping. My phone goes 13% to 0% while not on power saving mode at night. 3. Performance is not like Snapdragon but it's more than enough for daily task and for playing normal games.  Being a normal user I can assure you that you're not going to regret buying this.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I was looking at this phone before BBD and it was at the lowest price at that time, I didn't get it at lowest price but lower price of 33k and even at this price this device worth a lot.  Lavender color was my last choice but other options were out of stock so had to go with it. But believe me this color is the best of all.  Even back is plastic it doesn't look cheap.  My verdict. Camera : 5 Display : 5 Battery : 3.5 Performance : 4.5 Build : 4.5  Bonus: You get water and dust resistance along with wireless charging which is absent in this range.  Conclusion: if your priority is not gaming and battery life then this device is for you.\n",

Camera, display, performance, design, signal reception, speakers everything is good.  But at this price point this is one of the value for money mobiles.  One of the biggest advantage is Samsung is promising 4 years of Android updates, this device will get updates all the way to Android 16.  Overall, I am satisfied with the device apart from battery.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Trust me Its Camera and display is far better than my iphone 13. Amazing Low light photography with so many inbuilt effects. Object removal feature works perfectly. Only weak point is its battery but if you are not a gamer then you can use battery for 24 hours in single charge.. Go for it if you love photography..\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall good phone but battery 🔋 backup in decent. Camera 📷 is awesome.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The camera is one of its shining features, capturing high-quality images that are sharp, vibrant, and full of detail. Whether you're snapping a quick photo or recording a video, the camera performs exceptionally well.  The display is another strong point. It offers a clear, crisp viewing experience with excellent color reproduction. Whether you're browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the display delivers a visually pleasing experience.  However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. Despite the impressive performance of the camera and display, the battery doesn't seem to hold up as well. It drains faster than expected, which can be inconvenient for users who are frequently on the go and rely on their phone throughout the day.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using this phone as my primary phone for 4 days now. So a brief opinion I can provide about various aspects of the phone.  1. Display: Quite good, bright and nice-looking. No visibility issue in sun. Touch experience is good, the 120 hz refresh rate works fine.  2. Battery: With two sims and general office works/photo/video watch/phone call etc, it manages to last just the day-long. I unplug it ar 100 percent at 9 am, leave for office and return at 9 pm with nearly 30 percent battery remaining. It's not great, I know, but manageable. Actually samsung should come up with a faster charging capacity. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge from 0.  3. Camera: Front camera: A bit better than average, that's all. Back camera: Quite good, but again I have observed performance inconsistency. Compared to iPhone camera, there's still way to go. Colors are good, but not 100% natural.  4. Sound: No issue with clarity but lacks slightly in loudness. My 13k realme phone is louder (with clarity). But not much of an issue.  5. Call quality: Very good. No network fluctuations, no mic issue observed so far.  6. Aesthetics: Many don't really bother about this part. The positioning of power and volume keys are perfect. But the on-screen fingerprint scanner could've been better positioned. Reaching that much down is not very comfortable.  7. Performance: On regular usage I didn't find any lag. It's very smooth actually. But I'm no gamer, hence cannot comment about its gaming performance. Device is prone to getting warm, but not hot.  8. Network: I am not sure it's device issue or not, but with both my jio and Airtel sims, I often find slow data speed. My point is, upgrading from a 4G phone to a 5G one, no data speed improvement is observed.  Overall I'd say, under a 35k price tag, this phone is good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was extremely disappointed during first two to three days as the mobile was heating badly and battery life was bad and camera was not that great. I put return request as well. But from third day on wards, mobile heating issue was solved by keeping most of the apps in deep sleep mode. Battery life also improved a bit. My daily usage is office emails, teams, photo and video and extreme browsing. Battery gets drained 10% percent on 4g per 1 hour. I also capped the battery to 85% max charging to increase battery life. Charging takes one hour to become full(85%) Camera: I was using pixel4a for past two years. To say I am fan of pixel excellent computational photography. I was about to buy pixel 6a to continue my fandom but was sceptical about mobile signal issue, and lack of water proofing as i need water proofing and strong glass as my one year baby may drop the mobile accidentally or throw the mobile. So I bought this one expecting same quality of photos compare to pixel. My initial experience for first three days was not satisfactory. I couldn't get the same HDR quality pics or top class night sight photos. So I searched everywhere in internet to find gcam mode and tried many gcam mode but none was working. From third day onwards, i tried to understand the camera and editing options. Enabling motion mode made the pics blurry or s21 Fe camera is not intelligent enough to capture the best shot unlike pixel. So most of the photos were washed out due to motion mode. Now I am able to get good quality pics during good lighting conditions after disabling motion mode. And the best part of the editing feature is remaster image. When you use this option, samsung camera remaster the picture and stabilizes the image further. Also another good part of the cam is we can increase lighting for particular face when multiple people are in the picture. Results are very impressive due this as i can choose which one to be illuminated. Also i found working gcam for HDR pictures and night mode MGC by BGC. Because of this i switch to gcam when I am not satisfied with the inbuilt camera. I can confidently say after one week, i use gcam seldom. One great thing about samsung camera is pro mode. It allows me to play with many options and different lighting conditions. I came to know the camera hardware is extremely good and if you learn the pro camera, you can get super quality pictures. It's because of the software, pictures by this camera is some times fall under mid range. Video quality is excellent. Ois makes the video stable and i could capture many videos of my one year old kid and i loved the video quality. I would say it is better than pixel camera in good lighting conditions. Performance: mobile is snappy and i never saw any single occurance of slowness. It was fast and responsive. finger print is also very good, sensor is very good. Face detection is also very good and quick to respond. Display: display is bright and adaptive display is very good. Video watching in this mobile is way better than pixel. picture clarity is awesome. Victus glass is very strong, i don't have screen guard yet, my mobile fallen from three to five feet height more than ten times already but there is no single scratch on the glass. Software update: another good thing about this mobile is software update. I got latest security patch today which is way better than pixel . Samsung provides four years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. This is better than Google. Kudos to samsung for that.  Verdict: If you are looking for top class mobile with long term support, strong build quality, top class display and performance this mobile is for you. If you want flagship camera, then go for s22+. Overall i am very happy with this mobile and glad that i cancelled my return request (submitted in first two days).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic Device! Best in Segment just close your eyes and go for this🔥 being a Tech geek i heard that this phone has some crazy Heating issues and won't be surviving a full day with normal usage but even after a Heavy use(2 hours Codm,almost 10-15 mins of camera usage, Video Streaming at Highest quality+full brightness, etc) this phone easily ends with 15-20% battery left by the time it's 11:30-12AM. The main usp of this phone are its cameras and Display! I mean it's a Samsung S series phone and i guess that would be enough to tell what would be the quality of them both! Though Exynos 2100 heats up but not up to that extent which the youtubers were telling so close your eyes and go for it you will be enjoying worth every penny you will spend of this device. And Yes this device is Future proof as well i:e:- 4 Major Android Updates(till Android 16) and 5 Years of Security Patch Updates so you will not have to worry about changing your device after 1 or 2 years. Remember that the Video quality at night will be A bit grainy but the post processing will do the job after you have completed shooting the video.\n",

The designe is also really good simple and elegant Sound from the stereo speakers are really loud and crisp and and the display is one of the the best in the segment My only concern is the battery though i am not a heavy user, i hardly play any games still the phone barely makes it through the day when fully charged U can expect screen on time of about 5 and half hrs from this phone. I would recommend this phone to users who want great cameras with immersive multimedia experience Its not made for hardcore gaming.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been 3-4 months using this phone. [UPDATED]  Pros. 1. I've bought 128GB variant out of that 128GB, 122GB is occupied by Apps, Videos, Photos etc... still 0% lagg. Working like a brand new. 2. Unbeatable camera at this price, even some people ask are these pictures clicked from DSLR. Telephoto lens is capturing great pictures even in low light. 3. Good quality of display. 4. Feels premium as it's very sleek and light weight. 5. Fast charging, charges the phone in 1 hour 10 minutes. 6. Ram management is amazing.  Cons. (If you're not a normal user) 1. Battery gives screen on time of 5-6 hours. Use Power Saving for SOT of 6.5-7 hours. 2. Do switch to power saving mode at night before sleeping. My phone goes 13% to 0% while not on power saving mode at night. 3. Performance is not like Snapdragon but it's more than enough for daily task and for playing normal games.  Being a normal user I can assure you that you're not going to regret buying this.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I was looking at this phone before BBD and it was at the lowest price at that time, I didn't get it at lowest price but lower price of 33k and even at this price this device worth a lot.  Lavender color was my last choice but other options were out of stock so had to go with it. But believe me this color is the best of all.  Even back is plastic it doesn't look cheap.  My verdict. Camera : 5 Display : 5 Battery : 3.5 Performance : 4.5 Build : 4.5  Bonus: You get water and dust resistance along with wireless charging which is absent in this range.  Conclusion: if your priority is not gaming and battery life then this device is for you.\n",

Camera, display, performance, design, signal reception, speakers everything is good.  But at this price point this is one of the value for money mobiles.  One of the biggest advantage is Samsung is promising 4 years of Android updates, this device will get updates all the way to Android 16.  Overall, I am satisfied with the device apart from battery.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Trust me Its Camera and display is far better than my iphone 13. Amazing Low light photography with so many inbuilt effects. Object removal feature works perfectly. Only weak point is its battery but if you are not a gamer then you can use battery for 24 hours in single charge.. Go for it if you love photography..\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall good phone but battery 🔋 backup in decent. Camera 📷 is awesome.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The camera is one of its shining features, capturing high-quality images that are sharp, vibrant, and full of detail. Whether you're snapping a quick photo or recording a video, the camera performs exceptionally well.  The display is another strong point. It offers a clear, crisp viewing experience with excellent color reproduction. Whether you're browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the display delivers a visually pleasing experience.  However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. Despite the impressive performance of the camera and display, the battery doesn't seem to hold up as well. It drains faster than expected, which can be inconvenient for users who are frequently on the go and rely on their phone throughout the day.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best camera phone Avg battery Best performance S21fe = 1 ,iPhone13 =0\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using this phone as my primary phone for 4 days now. So a brief opinion I can provide about various aspects of the phone.  1. Display: Quite good, bright and nice-looking. No visibility issue in sun. Touch experience is good, the 120 hz refresh rate works fine.  2. Battery: With two sims and general office works/photo/video watch/phone call etc, it manages to last just the day-long. I unplug it ar 100 percent at 9 am, leave for office and return at 9 pm with nearly 30 percent battery remaining. It's not great, I know, but manageable. Actually samsung should come up with a faster charging capacity. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge from 0.  3. Camera: Front camera: A bit better than average, that's all. Back camera: Quite good, but again I have observed performance inconsistency. Compared to iPhone camera, there's still way to go. Colors are good, but not 100% natural.  4. Sound: No issue with clarity but lacks slightly in loudness. My 13k realme phone is louder (with clarity). But not much of an issue.  5. Call quality: Very good. No network fluctuations, no mic issue observed so far.  6. Aesthetics: Many don't really bother about this part. The positioning of power and volume keys are perfect. But the on-screen fingerprint scanner could've been better positioned. Reaching that much down is not very comfortable.  7. Performance: On regular usage I didn't find any lag. It's very smooth actually. But I'm no gamer, hence cannot comment about its gaming performance. Device is prone to getting warm, but not hot.  8. Network: I am not sure it's device issue or not, but with both my jio and Airtel sims, I often find slow data speed. My point is, upgrading from a 4G phone to a 5G one, no data speed improvement is observed.  Overall I'd say, under a 35k price tag, this phone is good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was extremely disappointed during first two to three days as the mobile was heating badly and battery life was bad and camera was not that great. I put return request as well. But from third day on wards, mobile heating issue was solved by keeping most of the apps in deep sleep mode. Battery life also improved a bit. My daily usage is office emails, teams, photo and video and extreme browsing. Battery gets drained 10% percent on 4g per 1 hour. I also capped the battery to 85% max charging to increase battery life. Charging takes one hour to become full(85%) Camera: I was using pixel4a for past two years. To say I am fan of pixel excellent computational photography. I was about to buy pixel 6a to continue my fandom but was sceptical about mobile signal issue, and lack of water proofing as i need water proofing and strong glass as my one year baby may drop the mobile accidentally or throw the mobile. So I bought this one expecting same quality of photos compare to pixel. My initial experience for first three days was not satisfactory. I couldn't get the same HDR quality pics or top class night sight photos. So I searched everywhere in internet to find gcam mode and tried many gcam mode but none was working. From third day onwards, i tried to understand the camera and editing options. Enabling motion mode made the pics blurry or s21 Fe camera is not intelligent enough to capture the best shot unlike pixel. So most of the photos were washed out due to motion mode. Now I am able to get good quality pics during good lighting conditions after disabling motion mode. And the best part of the editing feature is remaster image. When you use this option, samsung camera remaster the picture and stabilizes the image further. Also another good part of the cam is we can increase lighting for particular face when multiple people are in the picture. Results are very impressive due this as i can choose which one to be illuminated. Also i found working gcam for HDR pictures and night mode MGC by BGC. Because of this i switch to gcam when I am not satisfied with the inbuilt camera. I can confidently say after one week, i use gcam seldom. One great thing about samsung camera is pro mode. It allows me to play with many options and different lighting conditions. I came to know the camera hardware is extremely good and if you learn the pro camera, you can get super quality pictures. It's because of the software, pictures by this camera is some times fall under mid range. Video quality is excellent. Ois makes the video stable and i could capture many videos of my one year old kid and i loved the video quality. I would say it is better than pixel camera in good lighting conditions. Performance: mobile is snappy and i never saw any single occurance of slowness. It was fast and responsive. finger print is also very good, sensor is very good. Face detection is also very good and quick to respond. Display: display is bright and adaptive display is very good. Video watching in this mobile is way better than pixel. picture clarity is awesome. Victus glass is very strong, i don't have screen guard yet, my mobile fallen from three to five feet height more than ten times already but there is no single scratch on the glass. Software update: another good thing about this mobile is software update. I got latest security patch today which is way better than pixel . Samsung provides four years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. This is better than Google. Kudos to samsung for that.  Verdict: If you are looking for top class mobile with long term support, strong build quality, top class display and performance this mobile is for you. If you want flagship camera, then go for s22+. Overall i am very happy with this mobile and glad that i cancelled my return request (submitted in first two days).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic Device! Best in Segment just close your eyes and go for this🔥 being a Tech geek i heard that this phone has some crazy Heating issues and won't be surviving a full day with normal usage but even after a Heavy use(2 hours Codm,almost 10-15 mins of camera usage, Video Streaming at Highest quality+full brightness, etc) this phone easily ends with 15-20% battery left by the time it's 11:30-12AM. The main usp of this phone are its cameras and Display! I mean it's a Samsung S series phone and i guess that would be enough to tell what would be the quality of them both! Though Exynos 2100 heats up but not up to that extent which the youtubers were telling so close your eyes and go for it you will be enjoying worth every penny you will spend of this device. And Yes this device is Future proof as well i:e:- 4 Major Android Updates(till Android 16) and 5 Years of Security Patch Updates so you will not have to worry about changing your device after 1 or 2 years. Remember that the Video quality at night will be A bit grainy but the post processing will do the job after you have completed shooting the video.\n",

It's body is of plastic but very premium quality, back part is amazing with camera part looks like S23 2. Excellent Display. 3. 4K video recording. 4. Good battery. I bought portronics adapter for Rs 450. 5. Waterproof in this range. 6. Speaker output is amazing and gives good sounds and effect. Also has equalizer. 7. Split screen as multimedia enhancement. 8. Inbuilt health manager. 9. 4 years OS update and 5 years security update for both A 34 and A 54.  10. Last but not the least is the Brand Name of Samsung and respect u received while using it which is not in others Chinese brand  Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Galaxy A34 5G is a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor that cuts unnecessary parts and improves in just the right areas to transform into a well-rounded phone for its price range. Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option. Pros:  1) 120Hz display refresh rate  2) Flagship-like design  3) Main camera is very capable, with great 2x digital zoom  4) 4 years of software support and 5 years of security patches  5) Loud and well-sounding speakers  6) Tight haptics  7) Highest peak brightness for its price  Cons:  1.Slow fingerprint reader 2.Does not come with a charger 3.Slow charging speeds Edit: attaching camera samples after Android 14 one ui6.0 update.\n",

Details coming inside the photos are natural. 2. Battery backup is decent I would say not that much good but it's giving you good Battery backup. Also if you're using in power saving mood Battery draining is very low. 3. Charging time is good. 4. When I played BGMI on this phone there is no lag and also we can play smooth graphics with extreme frame rate and running good. 5. Design of the phone is great personally I love the Design of the phone. Personally I'll recommend to buy this phone without any hesitation.\n",

But in low light aur day time it's very good considering the comparison with other phones under 25k. Edge ditaction is good but needs more improvement.  IP 67 Rating is plus fr this phone.  It's very light without back cover, easy to hold and feels good and premium even with plastic back.  Looks of phone -5/5  Performance- 4.5/5 Smooth (I am not a gamer)  Screen- 5/5 Premium amoled better than other Chinese phone.  My previous phone was realms 9 pro+ . So you can judge my review on the basis of that. The camera in Samsung a34 is at least 2 times better than realme 9 pro + even that had Sony imx.  Overall 4.5 🌟 out of 5\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using for a month * Display is the best * Speakers are too good. Best for multimedia usage because of the display and speakers. * Battery lasts upto a day for medium use. But battery drain is there. Charging is on the slower side. * Phone heats while playing a medium game for 15 minutes and also after 30 minutes of continuous heavy usage. * Processor is okay-ish. Had felt some discomfort here and there. * Camera too is okay-ish. After processing the image quality certainly increases to an extent. But overall average. * Design is good but the phone feels a bit heavier. * One ui has a lot of interesting features. # Overall a good phone worth around 25k.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The A34 proves that for the overwhelming majority of people, the flagship devices are a criminal waste of money. This phone costs a fifth of the S23 Ultra, but has almost 80% to 90% of the flagship functionality. Full HD+ OLED screen, 120hz refresh rate, expandable storage, 8GB RAM and 256GB onboard storage, a very decent camera with OIS, IP67 water resistance, and the same design as the flagship S23/S24. And the Dimensity 1080 is good enough for the majority of every day tasks, including light gaming on CODM, and an amazing battery life. Overall, can't recommend this phone enough.\n",

You have to use third part apps. - Slightly bulky in design and slippery surface. - no inbox adapter or at least a case for better protection. - OIS will destroy youe video capturing experiance. It is having fault. Now I am not able to make stable videos in stedy mode. Even you hole the phone still the video is shaking because ois is damaged.  I will drop my review again in 7 days.

      "Rating: 5, Review: the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE 128GB variant delivers an almost flagship-level experience with its stunning display, powerful performance, and versatile camera system. The only significant drawback is the battery life, which might not suffice for power users. Nevertheless, for those seeking a high-quality smartphone at a reasonable price, the Galaxy S23 FE is a compelling choice that offers great value for money.Overall, despite the battery backup issue, my experience with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE has been amazing, making it a device I can confidently recommend to others.\n",

I'm fully satisfied with it, especially the night photography. 📸✨ However, there's a heating issue that I think is due to the Exynos processor. One suggestion: If you're planning to get an S23 FE, I'd recommend waiting a few months for the Snapdragon version. It'll be worth the wait!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This phone is featured packed. If you invest in it you don't have to think for next 2 years ya I know technology changes very rapidly but you'll be still better than low budget smartphones of that time. If you push your budget then you should always go for A series over M series, there is a huge difference in them still when they share same processors. Only disappointment I've to face with this smartphone is that it have hybrid sim slot and the 15W charger otherwise everything is good. You'll not regret.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

It's been a month of usage, I'm facing serious heating issues and battery draining. Afterall, it's beast especially for camera, vibration motor, crispy display.overall phenomenal experience 😍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone.  Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed.  Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing. It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating). The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.\n",

Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!! - 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Amazing Phone from Google. Perfect size. Nice colour. All good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",

Smooth android experience. 4. Display is good for content consumption. 5. Lil bit gaming is okay. 6. Backside look and colour is very good. Gives Premium feeling.  Cons: 1. Selfie camera is bad. 2. Battery drains quickly some time. 3. I faced charging issue with my old OnePlus Adaptor. 4. Performance is average. 5. The phone gets heat up while changing. 6. Using tempered glass can create smooth typing issues.  If your preference is just for Camera or normal use, You can go for it. Otherwise go for any other brand phones.\n",

I was a fan since Nexus series but now with the Pixel series specifically Pixel 8 they did a major upgrade complementing with AI and photography. Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Upgraded from Vivo y50 to pixel 8  1. Performance - Great 2. Camera - definitely better than apple in colour quality but have to improve in blur and potrait mode 3. Battery - after 90% charge it will give you 1 day battery life easily 4. Design - The Best in world 5. Display - it's too good  Bonus point (TiP) Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.  Please don't go for ambrane charger Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

But when u use this device, Then U feel like holding a Real flagship device better than S23 and iPhone 14. Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This is a great android phone with excellent camera quality. Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.  UI: very smooth UI you can feel flagship experience in it.  Design: its size is compact and great for single hand usage and it's design is unique. Haptic and vibration is so good .  AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

The phone was heating a lot even when it's in idle then I searched for heating issues and found out there is a adaptive connectivity service process running in the background and disabled it. From then the phone wasn't heating(sometimes while using camera) . Performance I don't play games so I never felt like there was any performance issues or lags.This is an excellent phone if you are considering to buy a stock android phone around 30-35k\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after 30 days of Usage  - PROS - Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter. - Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Design:  The Pixel 8 has a more compact design, making it easier to hold and use one-handed.  Display:  The display has a higher refresh rate of 120Hz, providing a smoother visual experience.  Camera:  The camera takes excellent photos, with good low-light performance.  Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",

U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: I bought this device with high expectations, but it turned out to be a nightmare. The device started heating up even when it was not in use, and I faced numerous issues within the first week of purchase. It only has two basic apps installed, yet it lags and heats up a lot.  The network on this device is a mystery, as I get better network speed on any other 5G-enabled mobile with the same SIM card and at the same location. The camera is also not up to mark as the AI features are not smooth as advertised. The ad is misleading in this regard, as it requires a good connection to upload images before the device can use those AI features.  Moreover, the device's screen has become unresponsive twice, and the camera is laggy. When I tried to use the hotspot on my laptop, it was not visible on any device, and the USB tethering option did not work either.  The device is updated and has the latest Android security update and Android version installed. However, Google's support is useless, as they asked me to drop the device at a service center, which takes up to 15 working days, leaving me without any option but to buy a new mobile to use during this period.  Apple's services are better than Google's, and I regret spending so much money on this device. It is not worth the price, and I don't recommend it to anyone. I suggest going for other better options, and if it drops to a very low price, only then consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

It's been a month of usage, I'm facing serious heating issues and battery draining. Afterall, it's beast especially for camera, vibration motor, crispy display.overall phenomenal experience 😍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a good premium stock Android phone.  Battery heats up (when exposed in the direct sun) sometimes and slows down the charging speed.  Otherwise it's a smooth and top notch phone as you expect from a Pixel device.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing. It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating). The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: What you'll like: - Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!! - 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pixel is King👑\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Amazing Phone from Google. Perfect size. Nice colour. All good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall a classy product.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The pixel ever used. 1. Camera - 10/ 10 the biggest Samsung sensors ever which is GN2. 2. Display - 10/10 crisp and 120 hz is fantastic. 3. Design - 10/10 Compact and not able to believe that everything is there. 4. Battery - 9/10 Decent battery.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is an average phone regarding the price. It is not justified with its price.  Pros: 1. Back camera is top notch. 2. Low light photography is awesome. 3. Smooth android experience. 4. Display is good for content consumption. 5. Lil bit gaming is okay. 6. Backside look and colour is very good. Gives Premium feeling.  Cons: 1. Selfie camera is bad. 2. Battery drains quickly some time. 3. I faced charging issue with my old OnePlus Adaptor. 4. Performance is average. 5. The phone gets heat up while changing. 6. Using tempered glass can create smooth typing issues.  If your preference is just for Camera or normal use, You can go for it. Otherwise go for any other brand phones.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.

Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice phone. Camera is simply awesome.Performance is smooth. No or minimal heating issue which might be solved by further updates. Battery backup is ok,if you are a normal user. Charging is faster with Google 30 w adapter.Not to be recommended for gamers. Overall performance is very good. Certainly you should go for it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: I bought this device with high expectations, but it turned out to be a nightmare. The device started heating up even when it was not in use, and I faced numerous issues within the first week of purchase. It only has two basic apps installed, yet it lags and heats up a lot.  The network on this device is a mystery, as I get better network speed on any other 5G-enabled mobile with the same SIM card and at the same location. The camera is also not up to mark as the AI features are not smooth as advertised. The ad is misleading in this regard, as it requires a good connection to upload images before the device can use those AI features.  Moreover, the device's screen has become unresponsive twice, and the camera is laggy. When I tried to use the hotspot on my laptop, it was not visible on any device, and the USB tethering option did not work either.  The device is updated and has the latest Android security update and Android version installed. However, Google's support is useless, as they asked me to drop the device at a service center, which takes up to 15 working days, leaving me without any option but to buy a new mobile to use during this period.  Apple's services are better than Google's, and I regret spending so much money on this device. It is not worth the price, and I don't recommend it to anyone. I suggest going for other better options, and if it drops to a very low price, only then consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing. It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating).

Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

I saw people talking about battery period. I found it similar to previous phone. Full charge giving me a full day battery as per my usage. The camera is good. Taking beautiful pictures at low light. Other AI features are also fine but haven't used those completely.  Not facing a heating issue as mentioned by many reviews. Overall good huy\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The pixel ever used. 1. Camera - 10/ 10 the biggest Samsung sensors ever which is GN2. 2. Display - 10/10 crisp and 120 hz is fantastic. 3. Design - 10/10 Compact and not able to believe that everything is there. 4. Battery - 9/10 Decent battery.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone is an average phone regarding the price. It is not justified with its price.  Pros: 1. Back camera is top notch. 2. Low light photography is awesome. 3. Smooth android experience. 4. Display is good for content consumption. 5. Lil bit gaming is okay. 6. Backside look and colour is very good. Gives Premium feeling.  Cons: 1. Selfie camera is bad. 2. Battery drains quickly some time. 3. I faced charging issue with my old OnePlus Adaptor. 4. Performance is average. 5. The phone gets heat up while changing. 6. Using tempered glass can create smooth typing issues.  If your preference is just for Camera or normal use, You can go for it. Otherwise go for any other brand phones.\n",

Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.\n",

Display - it's too good  Bonus point (TiP) Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.  Please don't go for ambrane charger Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100. Which is very dissapointing.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This is a great android phone with excellent camera quality. Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.  UI: very smooth UI you can feel flagship experience in it.  Design: its size is compact and great for single hand usage and it's design is unique. Haptic and vibration is so good .  AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

From then the phone wasn't heating(sometimes while using camera) . Performance I don't play games so I never felt like there was any performance issues or lags.This is an excellent phone if you are considering to buy a stock android phone around 30-35k\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after 30 days of Usage  - PROS - Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter. - Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",

Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",

U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: I bought this device with high expectations, but it turned out to be a nightmare. The device started heating up even when it was not in use, and I faced numerous issues within the first week of purchase. It only has two basic apps installed, yet it lags and heats up a lot.  The network on this device is a mystery, as I get better network speed on any other 5G-enabled mobile with the same SIM card and at the same location. The camera is also not up to mark as the AI features are not smooth as advertised. The ad is misleading in this regard, as it requires a good connection to upload images before the device can use those AI features.  Moreover, the device's screen has become unresponsive twice, and the camera is laggy. When I tried to use the hotspot on my laptop, it was not visible on any device, and the USB tethering option did not work either.  The device is updated and has the latest Android security update and Android version installed. However, Google's support is useless, as they asked me to drop the device at a service center, which takes up to 15 working days, leaving me without any option but to buy a new mobile to use during this period.  Apple's services are better than Google's, and I regret spending so much money on this device. It is not worth the price, and I don't recommend it to anyone. I suggest going for other better options, and if it drops to a very low price, only then consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons. Pro: 1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation. 2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates. 3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email. 4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone. Cons: 1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow. 2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well. 3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find. 4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes. Update after 1 month: 1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging. 2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure. 3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone. Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I got it yesterday; There is a difference between warm and hot! It feels warm when gaming (not heat) and it's slightly more warmer during charging than gaming(This is my true experience in one day whole usage). Kindly, don't believe others complaining, they are just bots. It's build quality is top notch buy back is slippery mind it! Get a case and other accessories as soon as u can. Camera, believe me Unbeatable! Battery when not in use don't drain but when in use, it drains ideally....not like superfast draining! Nope. All other experience again top notch. When you scroll the phone without switching to 120hz; you still feel like you are running at 120hz (believe me). And Yes, people notice and asks about pixel. Some are even crazy for it. 🤗 I was scared before buying but I'm glad now. I had manifested that I will buy a pixel someday and after 2.5 years; here it is! 🥰 Concluding: Please, don't believe people's saying it's heating or other problems they are FAKE! I'm from odisha, u know how much hot here! Go for Pixel Anyday!🙏\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price. Pros:-  Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.  Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates  Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone  Cons:-  Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.  Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone) The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples. The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures. The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem. AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better. So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.   HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day. The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable. The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.  I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.  All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size phone for a compact phone user. Hazel color looks amazing. It has the best display on a phone in the world(check DXOMark rating). The phone is quick and the touch is amazing! Battery life is decent considering display quality and the brightness. I'm yes and to test the camera, but pixel never disappoints in that genre😆\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.\n",

Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!! - 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics. - Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight. - Slick haptics - Battery lasts an entire day - Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS. - Superb value if bought during the sale.  What you may not: - It's a portable hand warmer. 8) - Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery. - Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!) - SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM - Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).  No phone is perfect and This surely isn't! Due to the unparalleled camera abilities, it's worth every single down side.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I was in deep dilemma for which phone to buy between I phones, Samsungs and One Plus. But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: An absolute banger of a product by Google. I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.  I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.  Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my first time purchasing a Pixel, after previously using the Samsung S23 and iPhone 14. I was getting bored with both the brands operating systems, so I decided to try something different.  I was initially hesitant about buying the Pixel 8, having heard about issues like overheating and battery drain. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  After using it for the past two days, here are my impressions:  No heating issues so far, it gets slightly warm, but nothing more than what you'd expect from other smartphones.  Battery life is better than expected, not as bad as some reviews suggest.  No call drops, whether indoors or outdoors.  Smooth performance for everyday use.  The camera is fantastic, especially compared to the iPhone 14. While it lacks a telephoto lens, the 2x digital zoom still delivers high-quality shots. Pixels reputation for excellent cameras holds true.  Charging speed is comparable to Samsung and iPhone flagships, which is fine with me since faster charging often reduces battery lifespan.  Full-day battery backup on average use.  I'm using both Jio and Airtel, and no network issues so far.  Overall, it's been a great experience with none of the major concerns I was worried about.  I strongly feel after using it that timely software updates by Google (promised for 7 years) have solved the majority of issues we hear about this device over the internet.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: As we all know if bought in India we don't get much of the AI Magic 😔.  Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.  Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.  When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.  So, if u are a true pixel fan go for this otherwise look somewhere else.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm not sure why there is so much negative talk about the product outside or even in Flipkart reviews about heating My device didn't heat up much yes there is a slight warmth in extensive usage that I observed in the iPhone too  Secondly I liked the pixel because of the AI dude this is way smatter than iPhone in most of the aspects  Finally it's up to you to make a decision If you want a smarter phone way smatter than apple then pixel is best  7 years of software updates and security patch that's insane\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This is a great android phone with excellent camera quality. Pros: Camera: picture quality is outstanding with Google processing after capturing makes DSLR like pictures.Edge detection is not perfect in portrait mode.  UI: very smooth UI you can feel flagship experience in it.  Design: its size is compact and great for single hand usage and it's design is unique. Haptic and vibration is so good .  AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.  Cons: Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.  Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.  Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.  If you are a tech guy and don't play games or not multimedia(YouTube/movie) user just go for it, if you get it less than 40k\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Initially when I received the phone I was disappointed. The phone was heating a lot even when it's in idle then I searched for heating issues and found out there is a adaptive connectivity service process running in the background and disabled it. From then the phone wasn't heating(sometimes while using camera) . Performance I don't play games so I never felt like there was any performance issues or lags.This is an excellent phone if you are considering to buy a stock android phone around 30-35k\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after 30 days of Usage  - PROS - Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter. - Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural - Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer. - Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot. - Battery is decent  Cons - As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once. - Finger print sensor is does not work flawlessly when USB tethering is active. Happened multiple times.  Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Design:  The Pixel 8 has a more compact design, making it easier to hold and use one-handed.  Display:  The display has a higher refresh rate of 120Hz, providing a smoother visual experience.  Camera:  The camera takes excellent photos, with good low-light performance.  Battery:  charge the phone to 50% in 30 minutes by using 30w pd charger (Google).  5 to 6 hours of screen on time.  Performance:  Good for normal users who needs pure android UI and smooth display working.  Cons:  Not good for heavy users .  Not good for gamers .\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will say if u don't play games and not a very heavy addictive user of phone then u can go blindly for it. The camera never disappoints you the screen makes you fall in love and it's haptic feedback and vibration motor... I will just say I love it ... U may find a lot of negative feedback and comments about the phone but it's not the way as they show it's far better and at the price in BBD sale it will be an insane buy to get it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Google has an overall winner with pixel 8. I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone. If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.  Pros: 1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere. 2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department. 3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use. 4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!! 5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range. 6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight. 7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.  Cons: 1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations. 2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions. 3. Speakers could have been better. 4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing. 5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.  Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I traded my Pixel 7 for this, I'm very happy with my decision. This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.  The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.  Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)\n",

You can get around 4 to 5 hours of screen on time and the charging is bit slow. The display is top notch and the camera is also great. But if you come to performance part and if you are performing normal day-to-day task, you will not have any issues. But as soon as you start doing heavy task it will warm up. Overall Good for normal users\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: I bought this device with high expectations, but it turned out to be a nightmare. The device started heating up even when it was not in use, and I faced numerous issues within the first week of purchase. It only has two basic apps installed, yet it lags and heats up a lot.  The network on this device is a mystery, as I get better network speed on any other 5G-enabled mobile with the same SIM card and at the same location. The camera is also not up to mark as the AI features are not smooth as advertised. The ad is misleading in this regard, as it requires a good connection to upload images before the device can use those AI features.  Moreover, the device's screen has become unresponsive twice, and the camera is laggy. When I tried to use the hotspot on my laptop, it was not visible on any device, and the USB tethering option did not work either.  The device is updated and has the latest Android security update and Android version installed. However, Google's support is useless, as they asked me to drop the device at a service center, which takes up to 15 working days, leaving me without any option but to buy a new mobile to use during this period.  Apple's services are better than Google's, and I regret spending so much money on this device. It is not worth the price, and I don't recommend it to anyone. I suggest going for other better options, and if it drops to a very low price, only then consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The real smart phone in the market..... Lets talk about it.....  Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome. A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature only.  Performance: Not the best processor in the market in this price tag but definitely the smartest processor in any price range. Not even iphone is close to its smartness. This is not a gaming phone rather one should buy this phone for AI experience.  Design: 9/10 because of its unique design. 1 minus for glossy finish, matte would have been more premium. Though built quality is very good n premium. This phone never lagged after 2 weeks of experience. Very few minor bugs. Best android experience.  Battery: In comparison to other flagships this is a great battery. Full day battery for casual users.Heating issue solved after update. *Other than this fingerprint sensor was failing frequently but it is decently fast. After software updating 80% issue is now solved. Other experience are very good. *Best Haptic engine, better than any phone.\n",

I was worried and was thinking to replace. But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance. Initially I was getting 4 to 4.5 hour of screen on time. But after week or 10 days of usage it started getting improved, now I almost get 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time. No other complaints so far. Highly recommended.\n",

Comfort to hold after installing case. Has a premium feel. The live translate,magic eraser,unblur are unique and wonderful.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Finest designed phone from Google and Best of Pixels. Awesome camera , Display and In hand feeling which no other brands can Match. The front camera needs little improvement, hoping Google will deliver its update asap. Thanks Google for a well built phone. Loving it😍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after 45 days of usage.Firstly the size of the phone is so perfect that it easily gets adjusted in your palms and easy for day to day use. Camera and performance is absolutely smooth and top notch. Except for battery (As my job makes me to call and receive approx 150 calls daily) which gives me 12 hrs backup (However on Holidays backup goes upto 20hrs) Phone is a must buy and the best creations of Google. Forgot to mention about Sound. It has great sound and the speakers are loud.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The in-hand feel was awesome. It has the best camera and night mode was superb. The image processing was too good, no other brand can beat it. Using this mobile since 1 month, I didn't get any issues. Loved the camera and unique design\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera performance and picture quality is superb but the different modes take significant time to change. So, software needs to be optimised. Phone heats up during charging and using camera Charging is super slow..like 1.5 to 2 hours at this age.. Really disappointed with it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: PIXEL 7  The phone is lovely. Hands on feel is good. Camera: Its great. Video stabilization at 4k 60 fps is good, and smooth. It cannot beat Iphone though, regarding color tonality and sometimes dynamics as well, myself having switched from iPhone 11. Even then, camera specs would stand next to iPhone. Battery: The battery life is good, good enough to last 11+ hrs with moderate usage. Display: The oled display is good. Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster. Croma chargers can also be an option. Note: I found no heating issue with this device. Only during the initial set up after purchase, did this phone heated up a bit, elsewise under heavy usage it tends to warm up a bit, but no extensive heating.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 1) Pixel 7 is definitely step up from Pixel 6 in terms of Software experience and bug management. Display is awesome with 90 HZ refresh rate. 5/5 in this zone to Google.  2) Sound is also good with stereo speakers, however could have been a bit louder similar to 7 Pro.  3) I love how the haptics are programmed in every pixle phone, they are just out of the world incomparable  4) Battery is kind of Ok, for me it does work for 24 hours with about 4 - 4.5 hours of Screen On Time  5) Cameras, for me its just average. Great for Still and Night Shots, good action Pan effects as well but the photos are overprocessed when it comes to Human subjects from Rear Camera. They get oversharpened and are sometimes kind of unusable. Also, the computational software of Google is inconsistent as it was in Pixel 6. Video shooting has improved a bit. The new Cinematic mode is a joke, the camera does not know how to calculate the focal distance at all So, if you are buying for 9* or 10* camera performance, it will not work. Samsung and Iphone camera is better in terms of overall quality and consistency.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Must buy in Android flagships. Everything is perfect but the battery drains quickly, hope it will be fixed in later updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Been using for 4 months now.  All issues regarding heating and battery drain are fixed via updates.  Pixel has the best camera in terms of Still photos, and over-all camera is just🔥  I thought switching to stock Android will have less features then other skins, but there are a lot of Pixel only features which make up for them.  The processor is very good for AI and Audio processing tasks, i haven't seen such accuracy with Google Assistant on any device.  Display brightness could have been better, just one thing I have a problem with, only in outdoor bright sunny day.  Regardless, this phone is a beast!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is a fabulous phone with few minor hiccups. Design and feel of the phone is awesome, I love this. Camera darkens the colour which is great for shooting the subjects, scene but that spoils the selfie as face becomes dark. Network connectivity issue is real, there were some issues like phone switching to 2g during call. Disabled 2g, removed sim, inserted again and restart fixed that. But it keeps happening. Google is aware of the issue and working on it. Hopefully that should be addressed. Performance is top notch. Fingerprint and face unlock is decent, not the fastest but works mostly. Battery life is sufficient, I get 5+ hrs of screen time with moderate usage. Overall I love this phone and its feel. Hope to have a great time with this.\n",

The only concern for me is the battery should be more long-lasting and shall support up to 65W fast charging, which is coming in all the smartphones. The display is vibrant and the speaker sound quality is good. At this budget , certainly the best Android phone u can have.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This pixel stands apart among the crowd of phones. It has a character to its built. Feels so comfortable in hand. Camera is out of comparison in its rivalry and is all in the glory. Pics taken in pitch dark turn out to be super clear. Day time shots are a treat to the eyes. Battery seems strong so far and is performing better than my previous sam flagship. The UI is very fluid and smooth. Overall, I am elated to have it.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: 1. Main Camera - Amazing !! If you are looking for the best camera phone under 40k, go for it.... Far better than those blurry iphone photos....Night mode is out of the world.... Best in class... But no 50mp photo... Felt very helpless for that.... 2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability. 3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not for hardcore gamers. For students and professionals, who just do their any kind of work, click photos, and do other stuff, it is pretty good. 4. Selfie Camera - Selfies are good, not bad actually, but don't expect best in class selfie. Other smartphones have way better selfie cameras. 5. Video - Video is the most underrated feature of Pixel. It actually shoots very good videos from both the cameras. 6. Display - Best in class. Though 120hz is missing, but you can't feel it. 90hz is very good for them who are coming from 60hz, and even it feels faster. 7. Haptics - Best in class, in some case better than iphone also. 8. Software experience - Very very good, after One ui ( Samsung S Series), the best android ui is this, the stock.... Shows what android can do... 9. Customisation Features - It isn't that customisable as Samsung, but it is good. 10. Battery - Good for them, who play less game in daytime,( Assuming daytime is the main concern for battery life ) can get easily 1.5 day of backup. A normal user gets one day backup, but if you are a hardcore user, who just uses phone all the day, you have to charge twice a day. 11. Charging - Could have been better... I don't have a google brick.... I charge with my 67w macbook pro charger.... And it is super slow....😅😅 12. Build - Feels premium...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Undoubtedly pixel 7 is one of the best camera phone as well as a good hardware too ever released on pixel. But comes to the battery life Pixel 7 still struggles to manage a wholeday battery life 😔 which is sad. New pixel 7 keyboard is one of the best which I ever tried especially speech recognition out of the world.  Pros Camera 10 out of 10 Performance 10 out of 10 Google gboard 10 out of 10  Cons Heating issue Low charging speed Battery life No charger in the box\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: One of the best products from Google. Ticks all boxes and overall a great package. Wished it was compact (coming from the Pixel 5 :P) but getting used to it. USPs:- Photography, Videography, Software, the custom chip (TG2).\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Wow 💥 boom ..... Excellent performance and cinematography Vera level\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Pros: Feels premium for sure. With glass back and metal body. Camera best in class. Good call quality. Good network not as people complain about not receiving signal. I had no issue with network. Catches 5g easily. Haptics feel premium. Dual speakers. Main speaker is the right one. Left is the mic. Buttons are tactile which I prefer as it gives the mechanical sound. OS is smooth af. Preferences may vary as even I would like some changes. For example no double tap to lock screen. No call recording. To clear all the background apps you have to scroll all the way to left unlike in other Android phones where you can just clear all by pressing the clear all just below the apps.  Cons: Battery drains fast. No double tap to lock screen. No inbuilt call recording. Heats up while using camera. Although cools down fast as soon as the camera is closed. May heat a little outdoor but can be managed. It's not bad as people complain. Not like redmi in earlier days where one can't even touch. Haven't checked while playing games. Since I am a regular user.  Purchase suggestion: Buy if the phone price drops to 45k to 46k. I bought it for 46k with big bachat sale and card offer. So got around 3k off. If you want clean experience with no bloatwares go for it. This will give you pure Android experience. Battery last 5 to 6 hours if used for light tasks. Ideally lasts for half a day. Needs to be charged in the evening if battery is fully charged in the morning. Not for heavy users who like specific performance like gaming for 3-4 hours at a stretch. As this phone may heat up and has a small battery. No lagging even for tensor chip and 90 hz display. I have compared this phone with one plus by visiting one plus store. One plus 11 even though has SD 8 gen 1 felt laggy compared to this phone although one plus may have less heating and better gaming. Scrolling through apps and other apps feels damn smooth.  So conclusion is if you're getting this phone at an offer, want good camera, good os, and smooth experience go for it. If not go for other brands like one plus.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing After using the pixel 7 for over 6 months ,  1. Camera and image processing is really good 2. Video recording quality and stabilization is awesome. 3. You won't regret after buying this mobile , if you are into mobile photography. 4. Night sight mode and astrophotography mode is lit🔥🔥. 5. Software experience is flawless . 6. Ai features are added advantage. 7. You can close your eyes and simply buy this mobile if you are searching for good mobile for photography in mid segment.\n",

I have used Xiaomi, Poco, Samsung Android phones in the past and i have to say that the pixel 7 is a different beast.  The only con about this phone is the battery life. I am not a heavy user and still the battery drains by the end of the day.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I am enjoying the phone. I think you need to be aware of your requirements before buying this one. If you want a good overall phone, solid build, very capable cameras and the freedom that Android gives you, this is the one for you. If you want a performance oriented phone for gaming and most megapixel counts to boast around, it's not the phone for you.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very happy to see Google taking India seriously and it's a great thing for pixel enthusiasts. Great phone, battery needs to improve more. The camera is exceptional no one can match up to the software magic of Google camera. This phone is for not someone expecting a powerful performance oriented phone but for those who love an ultimate and smooth flagship experience. The haptics are so good. So satisfying to use the way they implemented haptics.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: An Amazing Phone with Best Camera , Better Performance and Camera ; an Amazing Unique Design! Must buy Flagship. Switched from Asus Zenfone Pro M1 after 4 years. Little Heating issues and Fingerprint should firmly be pressed to unlock the phone.Will update about Battery soon! Battery update: Fine battery life\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Google pixel 7. It's fast. Beautiful has good cameras for normal photos. Portraits cinematic are just not really that good but normal video is also good. Not the best but still good though it's not a gaming phone, it could handle games just fine. It's enough for a casual gamer. The cameras are really good. One of the best for the price. If you live in a place where there is reception issues then then look out for the pixel connectivity issues because this phone has a weaker modem than the other samsungs and iPhones of the world. Overall, I think it's worth for the price. You are getting a phone that's recent as well as priced good. If you're looking for the other phones in the market you have to go for s22 or the iPhone 13 which or any year old at the point. This entire review is written by speech to text of the pixel 7 which shows how smart the phone is\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone!  Haptics are amazing! Battery life was poor for the first 3-4 days. Then adaptive battery kicked in and now I'm getting 24 hrs+ battery life.  It gets a little warm while charging but overall a great phone!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been only 2 days but so far all looks fantastic. Switched from Galaxy S22 and no major frustrations. Some features such as photo unblurr, magic marker were missing first but after the software upgrade, all appeared. Easy to use stock Android with Google's awesome tricks. Some slowness observed earlier but that also gone with SW upgrade. Hoping to have the same long term reliability I had with my Nexus 4\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera quality is beyond expectation. Device gets hot frequently, definitely something to work on. The look and feel of the phone is excellent. Smooth touch. Value for money.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Loved it😍😍 Pros : 1.Classy camera especially the night shots are amazing, selfie is also best in class. 2.very smooth user experience, No need to talk about the stock Android and updates from google. 3.Premium design and the haptics are awesome. 4. You will not face any issues for daily usage, adding this because many people says it heats while doing daily tasks as well.  Cons: 1. Fingerprint sensor, For me it works smoothly for left thumb but when it comes for right thumb it won't work properly. 2. Heating issues, If you are hardcore gamer or you live where the temperature is always high. Then please don't consider this one as it's gonna heat a lot if you play games more than 1 or 1.5 hours or the surrounding is around 40 degrees.  PS: can't say anything about tensor chip as it's sometimes pro and sometimes con for me I am putting a review after using the phone for almost 1.5 months, If I feel any pros or any cons, I will put them here. Talking about my choice, I knew the cons, but still I wanted to get this phone becauseI wanted to experience the pros🥱😝\n",

Cons:  Battery life could have been better. Need to top up twice a day. I am mostly on wifi network. Not sure how it will hold up if i start using mobile data. You need to get PD changer seperately. Google should have included in the box. Charging speed is slow compare to others. Device gets warm. Not too hot.. I miss a lot of short cut features, like taking screenshots with three fingers, alert slider (To Mute). I feel google should focus on these small valuable features.\n",

Without a case, we can feel the heat in the aluminium frame. But after 1st week it reduces, the phone studies our habits and somewhat rectifies. Battery is okay for me but for 50k, it could be way better. If you want to game, this phone is not for you. Processor is not that great. Charging speed - Dear google, whyy 20w? Its slow but manageable. Charging block costs another K. My advice : if you need a premium looking phone with good camera, go for it but if you are perfomance oriented, go for snapdragon processors.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's been more than 15 days since I started using Pixel 7. Initially I was a bit hesitant because of charging speed and overall battery capacity as on the other hand some phones were providing 100W of fast charging. However, I finally decided to go ahead with the Pixel 7 because of its machine learning capabilities.  Performance - 4.5/5 Tensor G2 has done a great job and everything feels smooth and snappy. Haptics are great.  Display - 3.5/5 90 Hz refresh rate is kinda good. Though the peak brightness is 1400 yet in direct sunlight the screen is not visible clearly.  Overall build - 4/5 Gorilla glass victus on front and back. The back is glass so it slips alot.  Camera - 4.5/5 Pixels are known for their cameras. Natural photos with good dynamic range. Moreover, if you are thinking of buying pixel then it's mostly because of cameras so I won't write too much.  Battery - 3/5 Here comes the weakest point from my perspective. It takes 1hr 40 mins to fully charge. Battery sometimes provide full day backup and sometimes degrades before the end of the day. I work from home so I do use the phone every now and then. And I use Dr Vaku 30 watt PD charger which delivers rapid charging.  Some perks of pixel 7 - 5/5 1. Remove people from the background works fantastic. 2. You can use Bokeh mode on any old photos. 3. Translation option automatically appears if you are reading anything in Hindi or other language. 4. Unblur feature is also great. 5. 'Now playing' feature is amazing which listens to songs playing in background and lets you know which song it is. 6. Extra dim and extreme battery saver are 2 great options for saving battery. 7. Always on display works very well. 8. Last point, unfortunately from pixel 6 there is no unlimited storage option available. I confirmed this from Google support community.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I Have waited until i could share this i received the delivery on 21 st jan.so its been 18 days i have been using the pixel 7 and here is what i have to say, before that let me clear this up i am long time pixel user from 2xl,3 xl then 4a and now 7..i choose to skip 4 and 5 as they were not available in india and i cannot opt for emi for my choice,  So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this. 1)Raw performance 2)long gaming sessions 3)Top of the line Hardware features.  If you get this phone you can expect the below 1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.  Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.  2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.  3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.  4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.  5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..  6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone  So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.  I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After using OnePlus for 7 years was waiting to switch to Google Mobile. Finally Google released it's flagships here in India after so long. The moment i see the available stock, i placed the order. Delivery was damn slow, it took a week. About the product; it's the best choice i made. Though you see better specs outside for the same price, but the stock Android OS with smart Tensor chip keeps this mobile miles ahead of them. Camera was amazing. It literally killing the professional photography. The smart post processing of photos and videos making amazing videos and photos. There are couple of things still missing for people in India. 5G support and Multiple active eSIM profiles. The hardware supports it but the Google has to push the supporting software yet. The promise was to push by end of 2022, but they failed to do it yet.\n",

Connectivity - don't have any issue cuz I mostly wifi user  Build quality and design - I absolutely build and design as it stands out from the competition, look and feel very good in hand better than iphone 14,  Performance - performance is kind a mehh.. but very quick and good for daily driver cuz app opening and loading is quite fast and smooth it never hangs boot up quite fast everything here is buttery smooth. But yeah not for power users  Battery - as I am coming from pixel 6a it's very good battery I wanted to buy new phone cuz my old one cannot get me a full day when I m on travel but this one easily does so o complains at all  Display - very good at this price I know it's 90 hz but animation and all are smoothest and it is quite bright also used in harsh sunlight no problem at all easily visible  Some cons- Front camera, fingerprint reader, slight heating issues but not that much\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after a month of usage of my first Pixel device.  Overall, this is an all-rounder device with a good battery, great display, and a fantastic camera and software experience.  The build quality is very premium as expected. The design is good to look at and the device is steady when kept on a flat surface (no wobbling due to camera module design). It's a tad bit slippery, so it'll be a good idea to use a back cover.  The display is crisp and the touch and haptic response is great. The 90Hz refresh rate is good, but a 120Hz would be something many would have expected at this price point. The colour saturation is good.  The software experience is an absolute delight. No bloatware, clean Android experience, useful Google features, no lags. Haven't tested any games (honestly, didn't buy this device for gaming).  The battery is good and lasts the entire day with moderate usage. One can even go for a day with heavy usage if you switch to battery saver mode when the device is low on juice. I have managed an SOT of around 5.5 hours on average, with a high of 8 hours. The charging, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's slow and can take about 1hr 45mins to charge fully. At this price point, one would expect faster charging.  And lastly, the camera. It's absolutely stellar. The pictures are crisp with good detail and real-to-life colours. The image processing of Google is just superb. Low-light pictures come out great with Night Sight. Portraits are good, but edge detection on subjects can be improved. Haven't got a chance to test out the other modes like Cinematic Blur, Motion with Action Pan, Astrophotography, etc.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Excellent mobile Camera - top notch Performance - snapy n fast Battery performance - decent. Last for more than 12 hrs on heavy and moderate use.  People are cribbing about charging time 1.5hrs . I feel it still ok as last for more time no need to change again n gain. Think you are getting top notch product at this price  My suggestion don't go for OnePlus or s22 at this range. Pixel 7 is really value for money.  Another reason I opted for 7 instead of 7pro because same primary sensor which same. Most of the time we click picture from main camera.. so not so much interested in telephoto or macro lens. 30 more is too much difference.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Actually I was looking for iphones having large internal memory storage 256gb and also having minimum display size upto 6.1. Camera expected to be more than enough. Not much bloatware.  But when I surfed for Google phones last 5 months. I was really appreciating moment for me that I will have one of this for me.  I have used all this phones like:-  Nokia 1650, Music Xpress in 2009 Samsung keypad 2010 Nokia Lumia 9 series, Micromax Canvas A in 2013 Samsung S4 in 2013 Sony xperia z3 compact in 2014 Blackberry keyone note in 2017 Moto G4 Play OnePlus 7T in 2019 Realme X2 in 2019 Mi A3 in 2019  After using all the above phones few which were my favourites. But because of battery and OS issues I had to now and than buy expensive phones  Samsung S4 Sony xperia z3 compact Blackberry keyone note Realme X2  Now finally having Google Pixel 7 last till 2027. Want i want is there 6'.1 display, limited camera, software updates till 5 years, high end security options, maximum phone settings, use as u want, 128 gb internal storage, best display, if u don't use internet and keep phone on extreme battery saver it will last for 72 hours i.e., 3 days till noon etc.,  Every month security update is available only by Wi-Fi so as there is no load on phone hardware.  Go for this phone as this is only and only available on Flipkart don't buy from any of e-commerce because Google customer team has already guided me online that they authorised only to Flipkart and no any other business partner.  One issue with this Google phone is the emergency accident alert is not available in Asia continent.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome camera quality, best in segment. The battery was not that good, I use mobile all day and I need to charge the battery 3 times but On 10th October, I have updated it to Android 14 and now the battery is working much better and the heating issue is there but we can ignore that because when we charge the phone it gets heated but after some time when you use it it manages well with the heating and maintains a decent temperature. I used to play BGMI and the performance is awesome, no lagging just some heating issue 😎. Overall the performance is awesome, attached some sample photos 👍\n",

Saw some bugs here and there in the phone, nothing serious. The main hardship is very slow charging. Looks like that is a common issue with other pixel owners as well. Hope Google fixes the above issues quicker.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm using this mobile past 3week lets see the pros and cons   Design and Build Quality : I love this Design....To be say frankly this phone comes with solid build quality with aluminum finish and side buttons are very rigid overall build quality is amazing..  Camera : Without any doubts i can say this is one of the best camera in flagship series i compared a image with iPhone 13 and google pixel 7 both images are similar no major difference i found as of now i say the camera performance is amazing and after taking the picture the OS optimization of the picture is very good..  Display : For my usage it is satisfied me in this display colors and Blacks are very accurate and smoothness also very nice.. While using the phone it give extra smooth performance. No negative feedbacks on display  Performance : I have not used flagships phone before this is my 1st flagship mobile but i feed really happy when i use this phone the AI performance of this phone is extraordinary more AI features and Stock android experience totally I felt google done amazing job in this phone with Tensor 2 chip and OS optimization I'm not playing more games but for a decent user this phone really beyond the limit  Battery : The only thing I noticed is Battery charging time is very high it took around 1.45hrs to full charge but after charging it gives decent battery backup it lasts around one day for decent usage.   Lets see the CONS  1. Some where I noticed little bug that's not really a deal the could fix in next update 2. The speaker performance is good it give stereo sound quality but the sound is little bit low when using in outdoor the sound is not sufficient 3. Battery charging is a major drawback\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Not a great phone. It's just a decent branded phone.  The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.  The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.  I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast charging and alert slider. Even the Tensor G2 is not that fast. to me it doesn't feel like I've upgraded my phone which is disappointing.  If you're using Pixel7 with tempered glass and fingerprint scanner is working for you please comment here. I would like to connect with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Clean Android as it should be. Yes battery and charging could have been better. But apart from that, better than iphone 13 camera, specially in dynamic range, the way it pulls up shadows in harsh sunlight. Subject seperation in portrait again better than iphone 13.  If expect a two day battery, iphone 13 is the best bet.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Being a photographer, I've upgraded from Pixel 6a to Pixel 7. Not much big change in rear camera. Front camera is slightly better than 6a. I've attached few images that I shot using pixel 7. When it comes to capture a video, pixel mobiles are very underrated. Butter smooth stabilization. You have everything to adjust while recording. Half of the work is done before editing it in some other apps.  I've seen a lot of reviews on heating issues. Initially, it heated up. Not facing any heating issues after the software updates. I don't play games so I can use it for a day easily. Fast charging does the work. Loved the editing features. Overall, a good buy. I rate - Battery - 3.5/5 Not bad compared to other reviews. Camera - 5/5 Loved the rear cam, front cam and portrait mode. All good. Performance -4/5, I haven't faced any lagging issues. Touch is smooth.  Ihaven't played any game so I will not say anything about gaming.  Pros: 1.Camera. 2.Editing features. 3.Smooth in touch. 4.Premium finishing.  Cons : 1. No charger provided in the box. Should've provided it. It costs additional amount to get it. 2. 2nd SIM is eSIM. You'll have to go to some store to activate your second SIM.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I Have waited until i could share this i received the delivery on 21 st jan.so its been 18 days i have been using the pixel 7 and here is what i have to say, before that let me clear this up i am long time pixel user from 2xl,3 xl then 4a and now 7..i choose to skip 4 and 5 as they were not available in india and i cannot opt for emi for my choice,  So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this. 1)Raw performance 2)long gaming sessions 3)Top of the line Hardware features.  If you get this phone you can expect the below 1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.  Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.  2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.  3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.  4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.  5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..  6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone  So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.  I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.\n",
      "Rating: 1, Review: Honestly don't buy this mobile. At this price this mobile is not worth it because even iPhone comes with better battery backup nowadays, also does not contain charging adaptor and it supports only DP charger so charger from 1plus, Vivo, oppo family may not support you have to buy another one.  You have to charge twice in a day for normal usage. The mobile heating issue is there, except the camera rest of the phone is normal like 1plus and family. Don't even try to play game on this phone your battery will drain in hour. Many bugs/issues still on the phone.\n",

You will find many posts related the same but in these 1.5 weeks of usage as long as I used the device, it kept on going better 😁. Display size is best if compared with the other 6.7 sized screens. Only one complaint is about the battery life. It doesn't look that good as at most it would extend up to 1 day.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best Android phone till 2023. I am writing this review after one month of usage and I'm speechless about how cool this device is.  Feature rich phone.... This phone gives you so many Android special features that other phones lack. There's a dedicated app that will show you the tips to use them. Apart from that u get free premiums and storage for many months. Switching to pixel can be done in mins ...That was amazing.  Camera : Beats any smartphone camera. The photos from this camera are so realistic and clear and no other smartphone can match. Of course iPhone cameras are very popular but pixel is so underrated. Realtone , magic unblur, nightmode , magic eraser. It takes slightly more microseconds to click pics than iPhone 14 pro but it's quality is much better or close to iPhone.  Videos - 4k 60fps in both rear and front camera. The videos come really good. OIS helps you to stabilize perfectly. Cinematic mode is bad ...Front camera videos too come perfect. the audio quality is especially top notch.  Haptics are amazing. Every haptic feedback is mind blowing.  The screen is of 90hz refresh rate and real smooth.  Charging - Average..It takes varied time to charge each time , it's not that fast. I had a superfast 65W charged phone before so I might have a biased opinion.\n",

I love the speed of it, really cool features which makes your day to day life easy. Loved the camera and especially at night makes brings everything alive. Only thing I felt a little sad about is the battery life but maybe it's because I am not using the OG charger!

Pros: Camera quality: on both photos and videos the phone is amazing, compared the still photos with brands like apple Samsung etc, and Google tops them all. Display: The display is amazing Haptics are just superbbb The experience is amazing as well Battery: the battery lasts well around 10 hours on low to moderate usage Performance: knowing that the phone has tensor g2, which was not supposed for gaming, the phone performs surprisingly well. Had no trouble in playing games or multitasking. The phone is smooth.  Cons: Charging: the charging is 20 W which feels slower than most phones. Heating issues: the phone does have its share of heating issues. Other than that it's amazing.\n",

Clarity is good but could have been better.  The battery gets drained within 3-4 hours of continuous use.. And takes 1.5 hrs for getting fully charged with the recommended Google 30W adapter..  2 Sim support with 2nd SIM as eSIM... And not having external SD Card support may be an issue for most of the people on Android....  Google can easily solve such issues...\n",

Bought it for 40Kchange in the sale by keeping exchange of my old phone Redmi note 8 Pro which gave me a good amount of 8600.  Coming to the pros:-  1. Camera is really awesome the pics are really good. 2. Performance is good. No ads ntg. Pure Android 3. Feels like a very premium phone. 4. Display fingerprint everything is running smooth. 5. Battery backup is good and lasts 1 day for me in weekdays and in weekends sometimes I need to top-up once.  Coming to the cons:-  1. It takes around 1 and half hour for a full charge with Google 30W charger. but that's okay for me 2. Not a gaming phone  That's it. No cons founded till now, will.update if there are any. So finally I can say Pixel 7 is the best phone ever!!\n",

Heating is the issue but after getting some system update issue got resolved.

      "Rating: 4, Review: The real smart phone in the market..... Lets talk about it.....  Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome. A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature only.  Performance: Not the best processor in the market in this price tag but definitely the smartest processor in any price range. Not even iphone is close to its smartness. This is not a gaming phone rather one should buy this phone for AI experience.  Design: 9/10 because of its unique design. 1 minus for glossy finish, matte would have been more premium. Though built quality is very good n premium. This phone never lagged after 2 weeks of experience. Very few minor bugs. Best android experience.  Battery: In comparison to other flagships this is a great battery. Full day battery for casual users.Heating issue solved after update. *Other than this fingerprint sensor was failing frequently but it is decently fast. After software updating 80% issue is now solved. Other experience are very good. *Best Haptic engine, better than any phone.\n",

I was worried and was thinking to replace. But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance. Initially I was getting 4 to 4.5 hour of screen on time. But after week or 10 days of usage it started getting improved, now I almost get 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time. No other complaints so far. Highly recommended.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The pixel 7 first impression - value for money. Rear camera is awesome. Front camera has a little less quality. The photo becomes over saturated after processing. Performance is smooth and reliable. Battery is good. Has a little heating issue after heavy processing and prolonged heavy usage. Requires PD usb-c 30w adaptor for faster charging. Comfort to hold after installing case. Has a premium feel. The live translate,magic eraser,unblur are unique and wonderful.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Finest designed phone from Google and Best of Pixels. Awesome camera , Display and In hand feeling which no other brands can Match. The front camera needs little improvement, hoping Google will deliver its update asap. Thanks Google for a well built phone. Loving it😍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after 45 days of usage.Firstly the size of the phone is so perfect that it easily gets adjusted in your palms and easy for day to day use. Camera and performance is absolutely smooth and top notch. Except for battery (As my job makes me to call and receive approx 150 calls daily) which gives me 12 hrs backup (However on Holidays backup goes upto 20hrs) Phone is a must buy and the best creations of Google. Forgot to mention about Sound. It has great sound and the speakers are loud.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera performance and picture quality is superb but the different modes take significant time to change. So, software needs to be optimised. Phone heats up during charging and using camera Charging is super slow..like 1.5 to 2 hours at this age.. Really disappointed with it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: PIXEL 7  The phone is lovely. Hands on feel is good. Camera: Its great. Video stabilization at 4k 60 fps is good, and smooth. It cannot beat Iphone though, regarding color tonality and sometimes dynamics as well, myself having switched from iPhone 11. Even then, camera specs would stand next to iPhone. Battery: The battery life is good, good enough to last 11+ hrs with moderate usage. Display: The oled display is good. Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster. Croma chargers can also be an option. Note: I found no heating issue with this device. Only during the initial set up after purchase, did this phone heated up a bit, elsewise under heavy usage it tends to warm up a bit, but no extensive heating.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 1) Pixel 7 is definitely step up from Pixel 6 in terms of Software experience and bug management. Display is awesome with 90 HZ refresh rate. 5/5 in this zone to Google.  2) Sound is also good with stereo speakers, however could have been a bit louder similar to 7 Pro.  3) I love how the haptics are programmed in every pixle phone, they are just out of the world incomparable  4) Battery is kind of Ok, for me it does work for 24 hours with about 4 - 4.5 hours of Screen On Time  5) Cameras, for me its just average. Great for Still and Night Shots, good action Pan effects as well but the photos are overprocessed when it comes to Human subjects from Rear Camera. They get oversharpened and are sometimes kind of unusable. Also, the computational software of Google is inconsistent as it was in Pixel 6. Video shooting has improved a bit. The new Cinematic mode is a joke, the camera does not know how to calculate the focal distance at all So, if you are buying for 9* or 10* camera performance, it will not work. Samsung and Iphone camera is better in terms of overall quality and consistency.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Must buy in Android flagships. Everything is perfect but the battery drains quickly, hope it will be fixed in later updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Been using for 4 months now.  All issues regarding heating and battery drain are fixed via updates.  Pixel has the best camera in terms of Still photos, and over-all camera is just🔥  I thought switching to stock Android will have less features then other skins, but there are a lot of Pixel only features which make up for them.  The processor is very good for AI and Audio processing tasks, i haven't seen such accuracy with Google Assistant on any device.  Display brightness could have been better, just one thing I have a problem with, only in outdoor bright sunny day.  Regardless, this phone is a beast!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is a fabulous phone with few minor hiccups. Design and feel of the phone is awesome, I love this. Camera darkens the colour which is great for shooting the subjects, scene but that spoils the selfie as face becomes dark. Network connectivity issue is real, there were some issues like phone switching to 2g during call. Disabled 2g, removed sim, inserted again and restart fixed that. But it keeps happening. Google is aware of the issue and working on it. Hopefully that should be addressed. Performance is top notch. Fingerprint and face unlock is decent, not the fastest but works mostly. Battery life is sufficient, I get 5+ hrs of screen time with moderate usage. Overall I love this phone and its feel. Hope to have a great time with this.\n",

The only concern for me is the battery should be more long-lasting and shall support up to 65W fast charging, which is coming in all the smartphones. The display is vibrant and the speaker sound quality is good. At this budget , certainly the best Android phone u can have.\n",

Camera is out of comparison in its rivalry and is all in the glory. Pics taken in pitch dark turn out to be super clear. Day time shots are a treat to the eyes. Battery seems strong so far and is performing better than my previous sam flagship. The UI is very fluid and smooth. Overall, I am elated to have it.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: 1. Main Camera - Amazing !! If you are looking for the best camera phone under 40k, go for it.... Far better than those blurry iphone photos....Night mode is out of the world.... Best in class... But no 50mp photo... Felt very helpless for that.... 2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability. 3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not for hardcore gamers. For students and professionals, who just do their any kind of work, click photos, and do other stuff, it is pretty good. 4. Selfie Camera - Selfies are good, not bad actually, but don't expect best in class selfie. Other smartphones have way better selfie cameras. 5. Video - Video is the most underrated feature of Pixel. It actually shoots very good videos from both the cameras. 6. Display - Best in class. Though 120hz is missing, but you can't feel it. 90hz is very good for them who are coming from 60hz, and even it feels faster. 7. Haptics - Best in class, in some case better than iphone also. 8. Software experience - Very very good, after One ui ( Samsung S Series), the best android ui is this, the stock.... Shows what android can do... 9. Customisation Features - It isn't that customisable as Samsung, but it is good. 10. Battery - Good for them, who play less game in daytime,( Assuming daytime is the main concern for battery life ) can get easily 1.5 day of backup. A normal user gets one day backup, but if you are a hardcore user, who just uses phone all the day, you have to charge twice a day. 11. Charging - Could have been better... I don't have a google brick.... I charge with my 67w macbook pro charger.... And it is super slow....😅😅 12. Build - Feels premium...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Undoubtedly pixel 7 is one of the best camera phone as well as a good hardware too ever released on pixel. But comes to the battery life Pixel 7 still struggles to manage a wholeday battery life 😔 which is sad. New pixel 7 keyboard is one of the best which I ever tried especially speech recognition out of the world.

      "Rating: 5, Review: One of the best products from Google. Ticks all boxes and overall a great package. Wished it was compact (coming from the Pixel 5 :P) but getting used to it. USPs:- Photography, Videography, Software, the custom chip (TG2).\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Wow 💥 boom ..... Excellent performance and cinematography Vera level\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Pros: Feels premium for sure. With glass back and metal body. Camera best in class. Good call quality. Good network not as people complain about not receiving signal. I had no issue with network. Catches 5g easily. Haptics feel premium. Dual speakers. Main speaker is the right one. Left is the mic. Buttons are tactile which I prefer as it gives the mechanical sound. OS is smooth af. Preferences may vary as even I would like some changes. For example no double tap to lock screen. No call recording. To clear all the background apps you have to scroll all the way to left unlike in other Android phones where you can just clear all by pressing the clear all just below the apps.  Cons: Battery drains fast. No double tap to lock screen. No inbuilt call recording. Heats up while using camera. Although cools down fast as soon as the camera is closed. May heat a little outdoor but can be managed. It's not bad as people complain. Not like redmi in earlier days where one can't even touch. Haven't checked while playing games. Since I am a regular user.  Purchase suggestion: Buy if the phone price drops to 45k to 46k. I bought it for 46k with big bachat sale and card offer. So got around 3k off. If you want clean experience with no bloatwares go for it. This will give you pure Android experience. Battery last 5 to 6 hours if used for light tasks. Ideally lasts for half a day. Needs to be charged in the evening if battery is fully charged in the morning. Not for heavy users who like specific performance like gaming for 3-4 hours at a stretch. As this phone may heat up and has a small battery. No lagging even for tensor chip and 90 hz display. I have compared this phone with one plus by visiting one plus store. One plus 11 even though has SD 8 gen 1 felt laggy compared to this phone although one plus may have less heating and better gaming. Scrolling through apps and other apps feels damn smooth.  So conclusion is if you're getting this phone at an offer, want good camera, good os, and smooth experience go for it. If not go for other brands like one plus.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I am enjoying the phone. I think you need to be aware of your requirements before buying this one. If you want a good overall phone, solid build, very capable cameras and the freedom that Android gives you, this is the one for you. If you want a performance oriented phone for gaming and most megapixel counts to boast around, it's not the phone for you.\n",

The camera is exceptional no one can match up to the software magic of Google camera.

So satisfying to use the way they implemented haptics.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: An Amazing Phone with Best Camera , Better Performance and Camera ; an Amazing Unique Design! Must buy Flagship. Switched from Asus Zenfone Pro M1 after 4 years.

      "Rating: 5, Review: The Google pixel 7. It's fast. Beautiful has good cameras for normal photos. Portraits cinematic are just not really that good but normal video is also good. Not the best but still good though it's not a gaming phone, it could handle games just fine. It's enough for a casual gamer. The cameras are really good. One of the best for the price. If you live in a place where there is reception issues then then look out for the pixel connectivity issues because this phone has a weaker modem than the other samsungs and iPhones of the world. Overall, I think it's worth for the price. You are getting a phone that's recent as well as priced good. If you're looking for the other phones in the market you have to go for s22 or the iPhone 13 which or any year old at the point. This entire review is written by speech to text of the pixel 7 which shows how smart the phone is\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone!  Haptics are amazing! Battery life was poor for the first 3-4 days. Then adaptive battery kicked in and now I'm getting 24 hrs+ battery life.  It gets a little warm while charging but overall a great phone!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been only 2 days but so far all looks fantastic. Switched from Galaxy S22 and no major frustrations. Some features such as photo unblurr, magic marker were missing first but after the software upgrade, all appeared. Easy to use stock Android with Google's awesome tricks. Some slowness observed earlier but that also gone with SW upgrade. Hoping to have the same long term reliability I had with my Nexus 4\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Loved it😍😍 Pros : 1.Classy camera especially the night shots are amazing, selfie is also best in class. 2.very smooth user experience, No need to talk about the stock Android and updates from google. 3.Premium design and the haptics are awesome. 4. You will not face any issues for daily usage, adding this because many people says it heats while doing daily tasks as well.  Cons: 1. Fingerprint sensor, For me it works smoothly for left thumb but when it comes for right thumb it won't work properly. 2. Heating issues, If you are hardcore gamer or you live where the temperature is always high. Then please don't consider this one as it's gonna heat a lot if you play games more than 1 or 1.5 hours or the surrounding is around 40 degrees.  PS: can't say anything about tensor chip as it's sometimes pro and sometimes con for me I am putting a review after using the phone for almost 1.5 months, If I feel any pros or any cons, I will put them here. Talking about my choice, I knew the cons, but still I wanted to get this phone becauseI wanted to experience the pros🥱😝\n",

Google should have included in the box. Charging speed is slow compare to others. Device gets warm. Not too hot.. I miss a lot of short cut features, like taking screenshots with three fingers, alert slider (To Mute). I feel google should focus on these small valuable features.\n",

Without a case, we can feel the heat in the aluminium frame. But after 1st week it reduces, the phone studies our habits and somewhat rectifies. Battery is okay for me but for 50k, it could be way better. If you want to game, this phone is not for you. Processor is not that great. Charging speed - Dear google, whyy 20w? Its slow but manageable. Charging block costs another K. My advice : if you need a premium looking phone with good camera, go for it but if you are perfomance oriented, go for snapdragon processors.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's been more than 15 days since I started using Pixel 7. Initially I was a bit hesitant because of charging speed and overall battery capacity as on the other hand some phones were providing 100W of fast charging. However, I finally decided to go ahead with the Pixel 7 because of its machine learning capabilities.  Performance - 4.5/5 Tensor G2 has done a great job and everything feels smooth and snappy. Haptics are great.  Display - 3.5/5 90 Hz refresh rate is kinda good. Though the peak brightness is 1400 yet in direct sunlight the screen is not visible clearly.  Overall build - 4/5 Gorilla glass victus on front and back. The back is glass so it slips alot.  Camera - 4.5/5 Pixels are known for their cameras. Natural photos with good dynamic range. Moreover, if you are thinking of buying pixel then it's mostly because of cameras so I won't write too much.  Battery - 3/5 Here comes the weakest point from my perspective. It takes 1hr 40 mins to fully charge. Battery sometimes provide full day backup and sometimes degrades before the end of the day. I work from home so I do use the phone every now and then. And I use Dr Vaku 30 watt PD charger which delivers rapid charging.  Some perks of pixel 7 - 5/5 1. Remove people from the background works fantastic. 2. You can use Bokeh mode on any old photos. 3. Translation option automatically appears if you are reading anything in Hindi or other language. 4. Unblur feature is also great. 5. 'Now playing' feature is amazing which listens to songs playing in background and lets you know which song it is. 6. Extra dim and extreme battery saver are 2 great options for saving battery. 7. Always on display works very well. 8. Last point, unfortunately from pixel 6 there is no unlimited storage option available. I confirmed this from Google support community.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I Have waited until i could share this i received the delivery on 21 st jan.so its been 18 days i have been using the pixel 7 and here is what i have to say, before that let me clear this up i am long time pixel user from 2xl,3 xl then 4a and now 7..i choose to skip 4 and 5 as they were not available in india and i cannot opt for emi for my choice,  So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this. 1)Raw performance 2)long gaming sessions 3)Top of the line Hardware features.  If you get this phone you can expect the below 1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.  Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.  2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.  3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.  4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.  5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..  6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone  So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.  I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After using OnePlus for 7 years was waiting to switch to Google Mobile. Finally Google released it's flagships here in India after so long. The moment i see the available stock, i placed the order. Delivery was damn slow, it took a week. About the product; it's the best choice i made. Though you see better specs outside for the same price, but the stock Android OS with smart Tensor chip keeps this mobile miles ahead of them. Camera was amazing. It literally killing the professional photography. The smart post processing of photos and videos making amazing videos and photos. There are couple of things still missing for people in India. 5G support and Multiple active eSIM profiles. The hardware supports it but the Google has to push the supporting software yet. The promise was to push by end of 2022, but they failed to do it yet.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after 1 month of usage,  Camera quality - quite good performs well at every scenario but the front camera falls behind in low light conditions.  Connectivity - don't have any issue cuz I mostly wifi user  Build quality and design - I absolutely build and design as it stands out from the competition, look and feel very good in hand better than iphone 14,  Performance - performance is kind a mehh.. but very quick and good for daily driver cuz app opening and loading is quite fast and smooth it never hangs boot up quite fast everything here is buttery smooth. But yeah not for power users  Battery - as I am coming from pixel 6a it's very good battery I wanted to buy new phone cuz my old one cannot get me a full day when I m on travel but this one easily does so o complains at all  Display - very good at this price I know it's 90 hz but animation and all are smoothest and it is quite bright also used in harsh sunlight no problem at all easily visible  Some cons- Front camera, fingerprint reader, slight heating issues but not that much\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after a month of usage of my first Pixel device.  Overall, this is an all-rounder device with a good battery, great display, and a fantastic camera and software experience.  The build quality is very premium as expected. The design is good to look at and the device is steady when kept on a flat surface (no wobbling due to camera module design). It's a tad bit slippery, so it'll be a good idea to use a back cover.  The display is crisp and the touch and haptic response is great. The 90Hz refresh rate is good, but a 120Hz would be something many would have expected at this price point. The colour saturation is good.  The software experience is an absolute delight. No bloatware, clean Android experience, useful Google features, no lags. Haven't tested any games (honestly, didn't buy this device for gaming).  The battery is good and lasts the entire day with moderate usage. One can even go for a day with heavy usage if you switch to battery saver mode when the device is low on juice. I have managed an SOT of around 5.5 hours on average, with a high of 8 hours. The charging, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's slow and can take about 1hr 45mins to charge fully. At this price point, one would expect faster charging.  And lastly, the camera. It's absolutely stellar. The pictures are crisp with good detail and real-to-life colours. The image processing of Google is just superb. Low-light pictures come out great with Night Sight. Portraits are good, but edge detection on subjects can be improved. Haven't got a chance to test out the other modes like Cinematic Blur, Motion with Action Pan, Astrophotography, etc.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Excellent mobile Camera - top notch Performance - snapy n fast Battery performance - decent. Last for more than 12 hrs on heavy and moderate use.  People are cribbing about charging time 1.5hrs . I feel it still ok as last for more time no need to change again n gain. Think you are getting top notch product at this price  My suggestion don't go for OnePlus or s22 at this range. Pixel 7 is really value for money.  Another reason I opted for 7 instead of 7pro because same primary sensor which same. Most of the time we click picture from main camera.. so not so much interested in telephoto or macro lens. 30 more is too much difference.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Actually I was looking for iphones having large internal memory storage 256gb and also having minimum display size upto 6.1. Camera expected to be more than enough. Not much bloatware.  But when I surfed for Google phones last 5 months. I was really appreciating moment for me that I will have one of this for me.  I have used all this phones like:-  Nokia 1650, Music Xpress in 2009 Samsung keypad 2010 Nokia Lumia 9 series, Micromax Canvas A in 2013 Samsung S4 in 2013 Sony xperia z3 compact in 2014 Blackberry keyone note in 2017 Moto G4 Play OnePlus 7T in 2019 Realme X2 in 2019 Mi A3 in 2019  After using all the above phones few which were my favourites. But because of battery and OS issues I had to now and than buy expensive phones  Samsung S4 Sony xperia z3 compact Blackberry keyone note Realme X2  Now finally having Google Pixel 7 last till 2027. Want i want is there 6'.1 display, limited camera, software updates till 5 years, high end security options, maximum phone settings, use as u want, 128 gb internal storage, best display, if u don't use internet and keep phone on extreme battery saver it will last for 72 hours i.e., 3 days till noon etc.,  Every month security update is available only by Wi-Fi so as there is no load on phone hardware.  Go for this phone as this is only and only available on Flipkart don't buy from any of e-commerce because Google customer team has already guided me online that they authorised only to Flipkart and no any other business partner.  One issue with this Google phone is the emergency accident alert is not available in Asia continent.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome camera quality, best in segment. The battery was not that good, I use mobile all day and I need to charge the battery 3 times but On 10th October, I have updated it to Android 14 and now the battery is working much better and the heating issue is there but we can ignore that because when we charge the phone it gets heated but after some time when you use it it manages well with the heating and maintains a decent temperature. I used to play BGMI and the performance is awesome, no lagging just some heating issue 😎. Overall the performance is awesome, attached some sample photos 👍\n",

Saw some bugs here and there in the phone, nothing serious. The main hardship is very slow charging. Looks like that is a common issue with other pixel owners as well. Hope Google fixes the above issues quicker.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm using this mobile past 3week lets see the pros and cons   Design and Build Quality : I love this Design....To be say frankly this phone comes with solid build quality with aluminum finish and side buttons are very rigid overall build quality is amazing..  Camera : Without any doubts i can say this is one of the best camera in flagship series i compared a image with iPhone 13 and google pixel 7 both images are similar no major difference i found as of now i say the camera performance is amazing and after taking the picture the OS optimization of the picture is very good..  Display : For my usage it is satisfied me in this display colors and Blacks are very accurate and smoothness also very nice.. While using the phone it give extra smooth performance. No negative feedbacks on display  Performance : I have not used flagships phone before this is my 1st flagship mobile but i feed really happy when i use this phone the AI performance of this phone is extraordinary more AI features and Stock android experience totally I felt google done amazing job in this phone with Tensor 2 chip and OS optimization I'm not playing more games but for a decent user this phone really beyond the limit  Battery : The only thing I noticed is Battery charging time is very high it took around 1.45hrs to full charge but after charging it gives decent battery backup it lasts around one day for decent usage.   Lets see the CONS  1. Some where I noticed little bug that's not really a deal the could fix in next update 2. The speaker performance is good it give stereo sound quality but the sound is little bit low when using in outdoor the sound is not sufficient 3. Battery charging is a major drawback\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Not a great phone. It's just a decent branded phone.  The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.  The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.  I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast charging and alert slider. Even the Tensor G2 is not that fast. to me it doesn't feel like I've upgraded my phone which is disappointing.  If you're using Pixel7 with tempered glass and fingerprint scanner is working for you please comment here. I would like to connect with you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Clean Android as it should be. Yes battery and charging could have been better. But apart from that, better than iphone 13 camera, specially in dynamic range, the way it pulls up shadows in harsh sunlight. Subject seperation in portrait again better than iphone 13.  If expect a two day battery, iphone 13 is the best bet.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Being a photographer, I've upgraded from Pixel 6a to Pixel 7. Not much big change in rear camera. Front camera is slightly better than 6a. I've attached few images that I shot using pixel 7. When it comes to capture a video, pixel mobiles are very underrated. Butter smooth stabilization. You have everything to adjust while recording. Half of the work is done before editing it in some other apps.  I've seen a lot of reviews on heating issues. Initially, it heated up. Not facing any heating issues after the software updates. I don't play games so I can use it for a day easily. Fast charging does the work. Loved the editing features. Overall, a good buy. I rate - Battery - 3.5/5 Not bad compared to other reviews. Camera - 5/5 Loved the rear cam, front cam and portrait mode. All good. Performance -4/5, I haven't faced any lagging issues. Touch is smooth.  Ihaven't played any game so I will not say anything about gaming.  Pros: 1.Camera. 2.Editing features. 3.Smooth in touch. 4.Premium finishing.  Cons : 1. No charger provided in the box. Should've provided it. It costs additional amount to get it. 2. 2nd SIM is eSIM. You'll have to go to some store to activate your second SIM.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I Have waited until i could share this i received the delivery on 21 st jan.so its been 18 days i have been using the pixel 7 and here is what i have to say, before that let me clear this up i am long time pixel user from 2xl,3 xl then 4a and now 7..i choose to skip 4 and 5 as they were not available in india and i cannot opt for emi for my choice,  So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this. 1)Raw performance 2)long gaming sessions 3)Top of the line Hardware features.  If you get this phone you can expect the below 1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.  Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.  2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.  3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.  4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.  5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..  6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone  So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.  I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.\n",
      "Rating: 1, Review: Honestly don't buy this mobile. At this price this mobile is not worth it because even iPhone comes with better battery backup nowadays, also does not contain charging adaptor and it supports only DP charger so charger from 1plus, Vivo, oppo family may not support you have to buy another one.  You have to charge twice in a day for normal usage. The mobile heating issue is there, except the camera rest of the phone is normal like 1plus and family. Don't even try to play game on this phone your battery will drain in hour. Many bugs/issues still on the phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best Android phone till 2023. I am writing this review after one month of usage and I'm speechless about how cool this device is.  Feature rich phone.... This phone gives you so many Android special features that other phones lack. There's a dedicated app that will show you the tips to use them. Apart from that u get free premiums and storage for many months. Switching to pixel can be done in mins ...That was amazing.  Camera : Beats any smartphone camera. The photos from this camera are so realistic and clear and no other smartphone can match. Of course iPhone cameras are very popular but pixel is so underrated. Realtone , magic unblur, nightmode , magic eraser. It takes slightly more microseconds to click pics than iPhone 14 pro but it's quality is much better or close to iPhone.  Videos - 4k 60fps in both rear and front camera. The videos come really good. OIS helps you to stabilize perfectly. Cinematic mode is bad ...Front camera videos too come perfect. the audio quality is especially top notch.  Haptics are amazing. Every haptic feedback is mind blowing.  The screen is of 90hz refresh rate and real smooth.  Charging - Average..It takes varied time to charge each time , it's not that fast. I had a superfast 65W charged phone before so I might have a biased opinion.\n",

I love the speed of it, really cool features which makes your day to day life easy. Loved the camera and especially at night makes brings everything alive. Only thing I felt a little sad about is the battery life but maybe it's because I am not using the OG charger!

Pros: Camera quality: on both photos and videos the phone is amazing, compared the still photos with brands like apple Samsung etc, and Google tops them all. Display: The display is amazing Haptics are just superbbb The experience is amazing as well Battery: the battery lasts well around 10 hours on low to moderate usage Performance: knowing that the phone has tensor g2, which was not supposed for gaming, the phone performs surprisingly well. Had no trouble in playing games or multitasking. The phone is smooth.  Cons: Charging: the charging is 20 W which feels slower than most phones. Heating issues: the phone does have its share of heating issues. Other than that it's amazing.\n",

Clarity is good but could have been better.  The battery gets drained within 3-4 hours of continuous use.. And takes 1.5 hrs for getting fully charged with the recommended Google 30W adapter..  2 Sim support with 2nd SIM as eSIM... And not having external SD Card support may be an issue for most of the people on Android....  Google can easily solve such issues...\n",

Bought it for 40Kchange in the sale by keeping exchange of my old phone Redmi note 8 Pro which gave me a good amount of 8600.  Coming to the pros:-  1. Camera is really awesome the pics are really good. 2. Performance is good. No ads ntg. Pure Android 3. Feels like a very premium phone. 4. Display fingerprint everything is running smooth. 5. Battery backup is good and lasts 1 day for me in weekdays and in weekends sometimes I need to top-up once.  Coming to the cons:-  1. It takes around 1 and half hour for a full charge with Google 30W charger. but that's okay for me 2. Not a gaming phone  That's it. No cons founded till now, will.update if there are any. So finally I can say Pixel 7 is the best phone ever!!\n",

Heating is the issue but after getting some system update issue got resolved.

I would suggest using only google original adapter for charging it charges rapidly.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The real smart phone in the market..... Lets talk about it.....  Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome. A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature only.  Performance: Not the best processor in the market in this price tag but definitely the smartest processor in any price range. Not even iphone is close to its smartness. This is not a gaming phone rather one should buy this phone for AI experience.  Design: 9/10 because of its unique design. 1 minus for glossy finish, matte would have been more premium. Though built quality is very good n premium. This phone never lagged after 2 weeks of experience. Very few minor bugs. Best android experience.  Battery: In comparison to other flagships this is a great battery. Full day battery for casual users.Heating issue solved after update. *Other than this fingerprint sensor was failing frequently but it is decently fast. After software updating 80% issue is now solved. Other experience are very good. *Best Haptic engine, better than any phone.\n",

I was worried and was thinking to replace. But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance. Initially I was getting 4 to 4.5 hour of screen on time. But after week or 10 days of usage it started getting improved, now I almost get 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time. No other complaints so far. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Its an excellent product from Google, i switched from Apple after using Apple phone since iPhone 3gs Days. I would recommend Pixel 7 if you are looking for pure Android, Quality at affordable price!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The pixel 7 first impression - value for money. Rear camera is awesome. Front camera has a little less quality. The photo becomes over saturated after processing. Performance is smooth and reliable. Battery is good. Has a little heating issue after heavy processing and prolonged heavy usage. Requires PD usb-c 30w adaptor for faster charging. Comfort to hold after installing case. Has a premium feel. The live translate,magic eraser,unblur are unique and wonderful.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Finest designed phone from Google and Best of Pixels. Awesome camera , Display and In hand feeling which no other brands can Match. The front camera needs little improvement, hoping Google will deliver its update asap. Thanks Google for a well built phone. Loving it😍\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after 45 days of usage.Firstly the size of the phone is so perfect that it easily gets adjusted in your palms and easy for day to day use. Camera and performance is absolutely smooth and top notch. Except for battery (As my job makes me to call and receive approx 150 calls daily) which gives me 12 hrs backup (However on Holidays backup goes upto 20hrs) Phone is a must buy and the best creations of Google. Forgot to mention about Sound. It has great sound and the speakers are loud.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The in-hand feel was awesome. It has the best camera and night mode was superb. The image processing was too good, no other brand can beat it. Using this mobile since 1 month, I didn't get any issues. Loved the camera and unique design\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera performance and picture quality is superb but the different modes take significant time to change. So, software needs to be optimised. Phone heats up during charging and using camera Charging is super slow..like 1.5 to 2 hours at this age.. Really disappointed with it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: PIXEL 7  The phone is lovely. Hands on feel is good. Camera: Its great. Video stabilization at 4k 60 fps is good, and smooth. It cannot beat Iphone though, regarding color tonality and sometimes dynamics as well, myself having switched from iPhone 11. Even then, camera specs would stand next to iPhone. Battery: The battery life is good, good enough to last 11+ hrs with moderate usage. Display: The oled display is good. Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster. Croma chargers can also be an option. Note: I found no heating issue with this device. Only during the initial set up after purchase, did this phone heated up a bit, elsewise under heavy usage it tends to warm up a bit, but no extensive heating.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 1) Pixel 7 is definitely step up from Pixel 6 in terms of Software experience and bug management. Display is awesome with 90 HZ refresh rate. 5/5 in this zone to Google.  2) Sound is also good with stereo speakers, however could have been a bit louder similar to 7 Pro.  3) I love how the haptics are programmed in every pixle phone, they are just out of the world incomparable  4) Battery is kind of Ok, for me it does work for 24 hours with about 4 - 4.5 hours of Screen On Time  5) Cameras, for me its just average. Great for Still and Night Shots, good action Pan effects as well but the photos are overprocessed when it comes to Human subjects from Rear Camera. They get oversharpened and are sometimes kind of unusable. Also, the computational software of Google is inconsistent as it was in Pixel 6. Video shooting has improved a bit. The new Cinematic mode is a joke, the camera does not know how to calculate the focal distance at all So, if you are buying for 9* or 10* camera performance, it will not work. Samsung and Iphone camera is better in terms of overall quality and consistency.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Must buy in Android flagships. Everything is perfect but the battery drains quickly, hope it will be fixed in later updates.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Been using for 4 months now.  All issues regarding heating and battery drain are fixed via updates.  Pixel has the best camera in terms of Still photos, and over-all camera is just🔥  I thought switching to stock Android will have less features then other skins, but there are a lot of Pixel only features which make up for them.  The processor is very good for AI and Audio processing tasks, i haven't seen such accuracy with Google Assistant on any device.  Display brightness could have been better, just one thing I have a problem with, only in outdoor bright sunny day.  Regardless, this phone is a beast!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is a fabulous phone with few minor hiccups. Design and feel of the phone is awesome, I love this. Camera darkens the colour which is great for shooting the subjects, scene but that spoils the selfie as face becomes dark. Network connectivity issue is real, there were some issues like phone switching to 2g during call. Disabled 2g, removed sim, inserted again and restart fixed that. But it keeps happening. Google is aware of the issue and working on it. Hopefully that should be addressed. Performance is top notch. Fingerprint and face unlock is decent, not the fastest but works mostly. Battery life is sufficient, I get 5+ hrs of screen time with moderate usage. Overall I love this phone and its feel. Hope to have a great time with this.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Simple Awesome from Google. Surely,the best camera in the Android Phone and it's UI is damn smooth. The only concern for me is the battery should be more long-lasting and shall support up to 65W fast charging, which is coming in all the smartphones. The display is vibrant and the speaker sound quality is good. At this budget , certainly the best Android phone u can have.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This pixel stands apart among the crowd of phones. It has a character to its built. Feels so comfortable in hand. Camera is out of comparison in its rivalry and is all in the glory. Pics taken in pitch dark turn out to be super clear. Day time shots are a treat to the eyes. Battery seems strong so far and is performing better than my previous sam flagship. The UI is very fluid and smooth. Overall, I am elated to have it.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: 1. Main Camera - Amazing !! If you are looking for the best camera phone under 40k, go for it.... Far better than those blurry iphone photos....Night mode is out of the world.... Best in class... But no 50mp photo... Felt very helpless for that.... 2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability. 3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not for hardcore gamers. For students and professionals, who just do their any kind of work, click photos, and do other stuff, it is pretty good. 4. Selfie Camera - Selfies are good, not bad actually, but don't expect best in class selfie. Other smartphones have way better selfie cameras. 5. Video - Video is the most underrated feature of Pixel. It actually shoots very good videos from both the cameras. 6. Display - Best in class. Though 120hz is missing, but you can't feel it. 90hz is very good for them who are coming from 60hz, and even it feels faster. 7. Haptics - Best in class, in some case better than iphone also. 8. Software experience - Very very good, after One ui ( Samsung S Series), the best android ui is this, the stock.... Shows what android can do... 9. Customisation Features - It isn't that customisable as Samsung, but it is good. 10. Battery - Good for them, who play less game in daytime,( Assuming daytime is the main concern for battery life ) can get easily 1.5 day of backup. A normal user gets one day backup, but if you are a hardcore user, who just uses phone all the day, you have to charge twice a day. 11. Charging - Could have been better... I don't have a google brick.... I charge with my 67w macbook pro charger.... And it is super slow....😅😅 12. Build - Feels premium...\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Undoubtedly pixel 7 is one of the best camera phone as well as a good hardware too ever released on pixel. But comes to the battery life Pixel 7 still struggles to manage a wholeday battery life 😔 which is sad. New pixel 7 keyboard is one of the best which I ever tried especially speech recognition out of the world.

      "Rating: 5, Review: One of the best products from Google. Ticks all boxes and overall a great package. Wished it was compact (coming from the Pixel 5 :P) but getting used to it. USPs:- Photography, Videography, Software, the custom chip (TG2).\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Wow 💥 boom ..... Excellent performance and cinematography Vera level\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Pros: Feels premium for sure. With glass back and metal body. Camera best in class. Good call quality. Good network not as people complain about not receiving signal. I had no issue with network. Catches 5g easily. Haptics feel premium. Dual speakers. Main speaker is the right one. Left is the mic. Buttons are tactile which I prefer as it gives the mechanical sound. OS is smooth af. Preferences may vary as even I would like some changes. For example no double tap to lock screen. No call recording. To clear all the background apps you have to scroll all the way to left unlike in other Android phones where you can just clear all by pressing the clear all just below the apps.  Cons: Battery drains fast. No double tap to lock screen. No inbuilt call recording. Heats up while using camera. Although cools down fast as soon as the camera is closed. May heat a little outdoor but can be managed. It's not bad as people complain. Not like redmi in earlier days where one can't even touch. Haven't checked while playing games. Since I am a regular user.  Purchase suggestion: Buy if the phone price drops to 45k to 46k. I bought it for 46k with big bachat sale and card offer. So got around 3k off. If you want clean experience with no bloatwares go for it. This will give you pure Android experience. Battery last 5 to 6 hours if used for light tasks. Ideally lasts for half a day. Needs to be charged in the evening if battery is fully charged in the morning. Not for heavy users who like specific performance like gaming for 3-4 hours at a stretch. As this phone may heat up and has a small battery. No lagging even for tensor chip and 90 hz display. I have compared this phone with one plus by visiting one plus store. One plus 11 even though has SD 8 gen 1 felt laggy compared to this phone although one plus may have less heating and better gaming. Scrolling through apps and other apps feels damn smooth.  So conclusion is if you're getting this phone at an offer, want good camera, good os, and smooth experience go for it. If not go for other brands like one plus.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing After using the pixel 7 for over 6 months ,  1. Camera and image processing is really good 2. Video recording quality and stabilization is awesome. 3. You won't regret after buying this mobile , if you are into mobile photography. 4. Night sight mode and astrophotography mode is lit🔥🔥. 5. Software experience is flawless . 6. Ai features are added advantage. 7. You can close your eyes and simply buy this mobile if you are searching for good mobile for photography in mid segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is one of the best Android experiences I've ever had. The phone is very smooth and the Android is clean and a treat to the experience. I have used Xiaomi, Poco, Samsung Android phones in the past and i have to say that the pixel 7 is a different beast.  The only con about this phone is the battery life. I am not a heavy user and still the battery drains by the end of the day.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I am enjoying the phone. I think you need to be aware of your requirements before buying this one. If you want a good overall phone, solid build, very capable cameras and the freedom that Android gives you, this is the one for you. If you want a performance oriented phone for gaming and most megapixel counts to boast around, it's not the phone for you.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very happy to see Google taking India seriously and it's a great thing for pixel enthusiasts. Great phone, battery needs to improve more. The camera is exceptional no one can match up to the software magic of Google camera. This phone is for not someone expecting a powerful performance oriented phone but for those who love an ultimate and smooth flagship experience. The haptics are so good. So satisfying to use the way they implemented haptics.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: An Amazing Phone with Best Camera , Better Performance and Camera ; an Amazing Unique Design! Must buy Flagship. Switched from Asus Zenfone Pro M1 after 4 years. Little Heating issues and Fingerprint should firmly be pressed to unlock the phone.Will update about Battery soon! Battery update: Fine battery life\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The Google pixel 7. It's fast. Beautiful has good cameras for normal photos. Portraits cinematic are just not really that good but normal video is also good. Not the best but still good though it's not a gaming phone, it could handle games just fine. It's enough for a casual gamer. The cameras are really good. One of the best for the price. If you live in a place where there is reception issues then then look out for the pixel connectivity issues because this phone has a weaker modem than the other samsungs and iPhones of the world. Overall, I think it's worth for the price. You are getting a phone that's recent as well as priced good. If you're looking for the other phones in the market you have to go for s22 or the iPhone 13 which or any year old at the point. This entire review is written by speech to text of the pixel 7 which shows how smart the phone is\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone!  Haptics are amazing! Battery life was poor for the first 3-4 days. Then adaptive battery kicked in and now I'm getting 24 hrs+ battery life.  It gets a little warm while charging but overall a great phone!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's been only 2 days but so far all looks fantastic. Switched from Galaxy S22 and no major frustrations. Some features such as photo unblurr, magic marker were missing first but after the software upgrade, all appeared. Easy to use stock Android with Google's awesome tricks. Some slowness observed earlier but that also gone with SW upgrade. Hoping to have the same long term reliability I had with my Nexus 4\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera quality is beyond expectation. Device gets hot frequently, definitely something to work on. The look and feel of the phone is excellent. Smooth touch. Value for money.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Loved it😍😍 Pros : 1.Classy camera especially the night shots are amazing, selfie is also best in class. 2.very smooth user experience, No need to talk about the stock Android and updates from google. 3.Premium design and the haptics are awesome. 4. You will not face any issues for daily usage, adding this because many people says it heats while doing daily tasks as well.  Cons: 1. Fingerprint sensor, For me it works smoothly for left thumb but when it comes for right thumb it won't work properly. 2. Heating issues, If you are hardcore gamer or you live where the temperature is always high. Then please don't consider this one as it's gonna heat a lot if you play games more than 1 or 1.5 hours or the surrounding is around 40 degrees.  PS: can't say anything about tensor chip as it's sometimes pro and sometimes con for me I am putting a review after using the phone for almost 1.5 months, If I feel any pros or any cons, I will put them here. Talking about my choice, I knew the cons, but still I wanted to get this phone becauseI wanted to experience the pros🥱😝\n",

Cons:  Battery life could have been better. Need to top up twice a day. I am mostly on wifi network. Not sure how it will hold up if i start using mobile data. You need to get PD changer seperately. Google should have included in the box. Charging speed is slow compare to others. Device gets warm. Not too hot.. I miss a lot of short cut features, like taking screenshots with three fingers, alert slider (To Mute). I feel google should focus on these small valuable features.\n",

Without a case, we can feel the heat in the aluminium frame. But after 1st week it reduces, the phone studies our habits and somewhat rectifies. Battery is okay for me but for 50k, it could be way better. If you want to game, this phone is not for you. Processor is not that great. Charging speed - Dear google, whyy 20w? Its slow but manageable. Charging block costs another K. My advice : if you need a premium looking phone with good camera, go for it but if you are perfomance oriented, go for snapdragon processors.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's been more than 15 days since I started using Pixel 7. Initially I was a bit hesitant because of charging speed and overall battery capacity as on the other hand some phones were providing 100W of fast charging. However, I finally decided to go ahead with the Pixel 7 because of its machine learning capabilities.  Performance - 4.5/5 Tensor G2 has done a great job and everything feels smooth and snappy. Haptics are great.  Display - 3.5/5 90 Hz refresh rate is kinda good. Though the peak brightness is 1400 yet in direct sunlight the screen is not visible clearly.  Overall build - 4/5 Gorilla glass victus on front and back. The back is glass so it slips alot.  Camera - 4.5/5 Pixels are known for their cameras. Natural photos with good dynamic range. Moreover, if you are thinking of buying pixel then it's mostly because of cameras so I won't write too much.  Battery - 3/5 Here comes the weakest point from my perspective. It takes 1hr 40 mins to fully charge. Battery sometimes provide full day backup and sometimes degrades before the end of the day. I work from home so I do use the phone every now and then. And I use Dr Vaku 30 watt PD charger which delivers rapid charging.  Some perks of pixel 7 - 5/5 1. Remove people from the background works fantastic. 2. You can use Bokeh mode on any old photos. 3. Translation option automatically appears if you are reading anything in Hindi or other language. 4. Unblur feature is also great. 5. 'Now playing' feature is amazing which listens to songs playing in background and lets you know which song it is. 6. Extra dim and extreme battery saver are 2 great options for saving battery. 7. Always on display works very well. 8. Last point, unfortunately from pixel 6 there is no unlimited storage option available. I confirmed this from Google support community.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I Have waited until i could share this i received the delivery on 21 st jan.so its been 18 days i have been using the pixel 7 and here is what i have to say, before that let me clear this up i am long time pixel user from 2xl,3 xl then 4a and now 7..i choose to skip 4 and 5 as they were not available in india and i cannot opt for emi for my choice,  So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this. 1)Raw performance 2)long gaming sessions 3)Top of the line Hardware features.  If you get this phone you can expect the below 1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.  Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.  2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.  3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.  4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.  5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..  6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone  So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.  I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: After using OnePlus for 7 years was waiting to switch to Google Mobile. Finally Google released it's flagships here in India after so long. The moment i see the available stock, i placed the order. Delivery was damn slow, it took a week. About the product; it's the best choice i made. Though you see better specs outside for the same price, but the stock Android OS with smart Tensor chip keeps this mobile miles ahead of them. Camera was amazing. It literally killing the professional photography. The smart post processing of photos and videos making amazing videos and photos. There are couple of things still missing for people in India. 5G support and Multiple active eSIM profiles. The hardware supports it but the Google has to push the supporting software yet.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Reviewing after 1 month of usage,  Camera quality - quite good performs well at every scenario but the front camera falls behind in low light conditions.  Connectivity - don't have any issue cuz I mostly wifi user  Build quality and design - I absolutely build and design as it stands out from the competition, look and feel very good in hand better than iphone 14,  Performance - performance is kind a mehh.. but very quick and good for daily driver cuz app opening and loading is quite fast and smooth it never hangs boot up quite fast everything here is buttery smooth. But yeah not for power users  Battery - as I am coming from pixel 6a it's very good battery I wanted to buy new phone cuz my old one cannot get me a full day when I m on travel but this one easily does so o complains at all  Display - very good at this price I know it's 90 hz but animation and all are smoothest and it is quite bright also used in harsh sunlight no problem at all easily visible  Some cons- Front camera, fingerprint reader, slight heating issues but not that much\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after a month of usage of my first Pixel device.  Overall, this is an all-rounder device with a good battery, great display, and a fantastic camera and software experience.  The build quality is very premium as expected. The design is good to look at and the device is steady when kept on a flat surface (no wobbling due to camera module design). It's a tad bit slippery, so it'll be a good idea to use a back cover.  The display is crisp and the touch and haptic response is great. The 90Hz refresh rate is good, but a 120Hz would be something many would have expected at this price point. The colour saturation is good.  The software experience is an absolute delight. No bloatware, clean Android experience, useful Google features, no lags. Haven't tested any games (honestly, didn't buy this device for gaming).  The battery is good and lasts the entire day with moderate usage. One can even go for a day with heavy usage if you switch to battery saver mode when the device is low on juice. I have managed an SOT of around 5.5 hours on average, with a high of 8 hours. The charging, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's slow and can take about 1hr 45mins to charge fully. At this price point, one would expect faster charging.  And lastly, the camera. It's absolutely stellar. The pictures are crisp with good detail and real-to-life colours. The image processing of Google is just superb. Low-light pictures come out great with Night Sight. Portraits are good, but edge detection on subjects can be improved. Haven't got a chance to test out the other modes like Cinematic Blur, Motion with Action Pan, Astrophotography, etc.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Excellent mobile Camera - top notch Performance - snapy n fast Battery performance - decent. Last for more than 12 hrs on heavy and moderate use.  People are cribbing about charging time 1.5hrs . I feel it still ok as last for more time no need to change again n gain. Think you are getting top notch product at this price  My suggestion don't go for OnePlus or s22 at this range. Pixel 7 is really value for money.  Another reason I opted for 7 instead of 7pro because same primary sensor which same. Most of the time we click picture from main camera.. so not so much interested in telephoto or macro lens. 30 more is too much difference.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Actually I was looking for iphones having large internal memory storage 256gb and also having minimum display size upto 6.1. Camera expected to be more than enough. Not much bloatware.  But when I surfed for Google phones last 5 months. I was really appreciating moment for me that I will have one of this for me.  I have used all this phones like:-  Nokia 1650, Music Xpress in 2009 Samsung keypad 2010 Nokia Lumia 9 series, Micromax Canvas A in 2013 Samsung S4 in 2013 Sony xperia z3 compact in 2014 Blackberry keyone note in 2017 Moto G4 Play OnePlus 7T in 2019 Realme X2 in 2019 Mi A3 in 2019  After using all the above phones few which were my favourites. But because of battery and OS issues I had to now and than buy expensive phones  Samsung S4 Sony xperia z3 compact Blackberry keyone note Realme X2  Now finally having Google Pixel 7 last till 2027. Want i want is there 6'.1 display, limited camera, software updates till 5 years, high end security options, maximum phone settings, use as u want, 128 gb internal storage, best display, if u don't use internet and keep phone on extreme battery saver it will last for 72 hours i.e., 3 days till noon etc.,  Every month security update is available only by Wi-Fi so as there is no load on phone hardware.  Go for this phone as this is only and only available on Flipkart don't buy from any of e-commerce because Google customer team has already guided me online that they authorised only to Flipkart and no any other business partner.  One issue with this Google phone is the emergency accident alert is not available in Asia continent.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome camera quality, best in segment. The battery was not that good, I use mobile all day and I need to charge the battery 3 times but On 10th October, I have updated it to Android 14 and now the battery is working much better and the heating issue is there but we can ignore that because when we charge the phone it gets heated but after some time when you use it it manages well with the heating and maintains a decent temperature. I used to play BGMI and the performance is awesome, no lagging just some heating issue 😎. Overall the performance is awesome, attached some sample photos 👍\n",

Saw some bugs here and there in the phone, nothing serious. The main hardship is very slow charging. Looks like that is a common issue with other pixel owners as well. Hope Google fixes the above issues quicker.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm using this mobile past 3week lets see the pros and cons   Design and Build Quality : I love this Design....To be say frankly this phone comes with solid build quality with aluminum finish and side buttons are very rigid overall build quality is amazing..  Camera : Without any doubts i can say this is one of the best camera in flagship series i compared a image with iPhone 13 and google pixel 7 both images are similar no major difference i found as of now i say the camera performance is amazing and after taking the picture the OS optimization of the picture is very good..  Display : For my usage it is satisfied me in this display colors and Blacks are very accurate and smoothness also very nice.. While using the phone it give extra smooth performance. No negative feedbacks on display  Performance : I have not used flagships phone before this is my 1st flagship mobile but i feed really happy when i use this phone the AI performance of this phone is extraordinary more AI features and Stock android experience totally I felt google done amazing job in this phone with Tensor 2 chip and OS optimization I'm not playing more games but for a decent user this phone really beyond the limit  Battery : The only thing I noticed is Battery charging time is very high it took around 1.45hrs to full charge but after charging it gives decent battery backup it lasts around one day for decent usage.   Lets see the CONS  1. Some where I noticed little bug that's not really a deal the could fix in next update 2. The speaker performance is good it give stereo sound quality but the sound is little bit low when using in outdoor the sound is not sufficient 3. Battery charging is a major drawback\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Not a great phone. It's just a decent branded phone.  The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.  The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.  I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast charging and alert slider. Even the Tensor G2 is not that fast. to me it doesn't feel like I've upgraded my phone which is disappointing.  If you're using Pixel7 with tempered glass and fingerprint scanner is working for you please comment here. I would like to connect with you.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Being a photographer, I've upgraded from Pixel 6a to Pixel 7. Not much big change in rear camera. Front camera is slightly better than 6a. I've attached few images that I shot using pixel 7. When it comes to capture a video, pixel mobiles are very underrated. Butter smooth stabilization. You have everything to adjust while recording. Half of the work is done before editing it in some other apps.  I've seen a lot of reviews on heating issues. Initially, it heated up. Not facing any heating issues after the software updates. I don't play games so I can use it for a day easily. Fast charging does the work. Loved the editing features. Overall, a good buy. I rate - Battery - 3.5/5 Not bad compared to other reviews. Camera - 5/5 Loved the rear cam, front cam and portrait mode. All good. Performance -4/5, I haven't faced any lagging issues. Touch is smooth.  Ihaven't played any game so I will not say anything about gaming.  Pros: 1.Camera. 2.Editing features. 3.Smooth in touch. 4.Premium finishing.  Cons : 1. No charger provided in the box. Should've provided it. It costs additional amount to get it. 2. 2nd SIM is eSIM. You'll have to go to some store to activate your second SIM.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I Have waited until i could share this i received the delivery on 21 st jan.so its been 18 days i have been using the pixel 7 and here is what i have to say, before that let me clear this up i am long time pixel user from 2xl,3 xl then 4a and now 7..i choose to skip 4 and 5 as they were not available in india and i cannot opt for emi for my choice,  So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this. 1)Raw performance 2)long gaming sessions 3)Top of the line Hardware features.  If you get this phone you can expect the below 1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.  Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.  2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.  3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.  4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.  5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..  6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone  So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.  I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.\n",
      "Rating: 1, Review: Honestly don't buy this mobile. At this price this mobile is not worth it because even iPhone comes with better battery backup nowadays, also does not contain charging adaptor and it supports only DP charger so charger from 1plus, Vivo, oppo family may not support you have to buy another one.  You have to charge twice in a day for normal usage. The mobile heating issue is there, except the camera rest of the phone is normal like 1plus and family. Don't even try to play game on this phone your battery will drain in hour. Many bugs/issues still on the phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best Android phone till 2023. I am writing this review after one month of usage and I'm speechless about how cool this device is.  Feature rich phone.... This phone gives you so many Android special features that other phones lack. There's a dedicated app that will show you the tips to use them. Apart from that u get free premiums and storage for many months. Switching to pixel can be done in mins ...That was amazing.  Camera : Beats any smartphone camera. The photos from this camera are so realistic and clear and no other smartphone can match. Of course iPhone cameras are very popular but pixel is so underrated. Realtone , magic unblur, nightmode , magic eraser. It takes slightly more microseconds to click pics than iPhone 14 pro but it's quality is much better or close to iPhone.  Videos - 4k 60fps in both rear and front camera. The videos come really good. OIS helps you to stabilize perfectly. Cinematic mode is bad ...Front camera videos too come perfect. the audio quality is especially top notch.  Haptics are amazing. Every haptic feedback is mind blowing.  The screen is of 90hz refresh rate and real smooth.  Charging - Average..It takes varied time to charge each time , it's not that fast. I had a superfast 65W charged phone before so I might have a biased opinion.\n",

I love the speed of it, really cool features which makes your day to day life easy. Loved the camera and especially at night makes brings everything alive.

Pros: Camera quality: on both photos and videos the phone is amazing, compared the still photos with brands like apple Samsung etc, and Google tops them all. Display: The display is amazing Haptics are just superbbb The experience is amazing as well Battery: the battery lasts well around 10 hours on low to moderate usage Performance: knowing that the phone has tensor g2, which was not supposed for gaming, the phone performs surprisingly well. Had no trouble in playing games or multitasking. The phone is smooth.  Cons: Charging: the charging is 20 W which feels slower than most phones. Heating issues: the phone does have its share of heating issues. Other than that it's amazing.\n",

Clarity is good but could have been better.  The battery gets drained within 3-4 hours of continuous use.. And takes 1.5 hrs for getting fully charged with the recommended Google 30W adapter..  2 Sim support with 2nd SIM as eSIM... And not having external SD Card support may be an issue for most of the people on Android....  Google can easily solve such issues...\n",

Bought it for 40Kchange in the sale by keeping exchange of my old phone Redmi note 8 Pro which gave me a good amount of 8600.  Coming to the pros:-  1. Camera is really awesome the pics are really good. 2. Performance is good. No ads ntg. Pure Android 3. Feels like a very premium phone. 4. Display fingerprint everything is running smooth. 5. Battery backup is good and lasts 1 day for me in weekdays and in weekends sometimes I need to top-up once.  Coming to the cons:-  1. It takes around 1 and half hour for a full charge with Google 30W charger. but that's okay for me 2. Not a gaming phone  That's it. No cons founded till now, will.update if there are any. So finally I can say Pixel 7 is the best phone ever!!\n",

Heating is the issue but after getting some system update issue got resolved.

All phones has its cons.....if you like pixel like os, good battery, gaming, media consumption then good for this.  For me, coming from OnePlus 5, this phone is awesome and also I don't hate it's camera.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Wow! This has been a terrific purchase. I am very much satisfied with this buy. Battery - Excellent for a flagship. Easy SOT of 7-8 hrs on 120Hz Display - 144Hz rocks. The display is crisp and the curve display feels so premium. Performance - 8+ Gen 1 is an Excellent performer. Does not heat much even while gaming. Build - Very Solid 9.5/10 coz back is slippery. Camera - Hardware is good. moto just needs to work on Software processing. Software - Excellent Near to stock Android. Just came across a few bugs but can be fixed with an update.  Overall - Never expected this from Motorola. Excellent flagship smartphone. Worth the money if you're getting near 40-42 K. I think Motorola is next OnePlus.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Well, i have been looking for this device for so long , not just due to the 200mp but due to the value for money which it creates,  Camera is not terrific ,but frankly speaking its still the best when compared with flagship devices , it lacks consistency which can be improved with an update which surely they will  Performance is absolutely a beast , no other words can define it. No lag whatsoever  Battery life is one of the best in flagship category and you can easily get a day or day and a half  Software is buttery smooth , i feel like i am using a pixel device  In hand feel is premium  Display is top notch  Sound is superb  Overall its a complete package for this price for a 256gb phone  If there is a scale of 100, i would rate it at 92 , if camera software optimisation improves then its surely 99/100  The worst part i felt is the delivery part , it took more than 14 days to reach also the seller doesn't give ang information of delaying. Flipkart needs to rethink with this deller\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: A good performance phone with a pretty average camera. Brilliant display, premium looks, Super speed battery charging. Heats up while charging and while using the camera.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Back from APPLE TO ANDROID- I waited for Nothing 2 but due to camera complaints and stability issues I went for this MOTO with 200MP CAM. I have compared it with iPhone 14 PRO and the camera of this phone is far more better than iPhone. Plus we get a 125 watt charger in box and the best part is THE Moto Ready For feature that allows me to use the phone like a computer just by connecting it to a monitor or tv. The SD GEN1 is buttery smooth processor with no heating. 12gb ram is a boost plus this has wireless charge and reverse wireless charge. Believe me guys go blindly for it. It's worth the Money and I have heard from my friend that android 13 is far far better, smooth and battery life is amazing too. Don't regret leaving Apple (12) and coming back to Android. Thank you moto for keeping this clean\n",

I felt it had better camera. There were no proper updates on my order.  Update - received Android 13 update. Everything has improved. Battery life is unbelievable after, got 9hrs+ of SOT and I still had 15% battery left. after any update phones battery will become even worst but not in this case. Everyone is complaining about updates. they take time, to give bug free upgrade. They nailed it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Using since 3 days, bought for 41k with exchange  Pros 1 Design - looks and feel premium flagship specially the display  2 Camera - if you know how to use camera to get better output images, then this beat iPhone Camera (Front and back both produced great images, after update to Android 13 low light images improves), otherwise you can go honor 90 for colour boosted images  3 Performance - Good if you are moderate gamer, for heavy gaming (play around 2-3 hours with high graphics and high refresh rate) don't consider, the stock Android feels good with Moto Security apps is bonus, After Android 13 update most of the previous issues resolved  4 Battery - I am moderate user 1 hour gaming, calls and normal browsing get SOT around 6 to 6:30 hour (Refresh rate is Auto), (little heating while charging but no worries as we used 125 watt charger which done 26 min from 10 to 100%)  Cons 1 Updates - Motorola needs to work on timely update otherwise no issues\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this handset since last 10 to 15 days and I would like to say Motorola has done an excellent job this time with this flagship piece.  1. Camera quality improved post installation of Android 13 update 2. Wide angle brings an excellent snap 3. Battery backup is excellent. I use this handset as my primary phone and still it gives 7 to 8 hours of SOT 4. Extremely smooth silky navigation 5. From the design perspective it's pretty good as always with gorilla glass protection at the both side 6. It takes max 25mnts to get full charge from 5% to 100% 7.

      "Rating: 5, Review: The product is really amazing. Pros- Camera, processor,clock speed, display,144hz refresh rate, bgmi in 60fps in hd graphics and 90fps in low specs,edge light,chop flash light, curve p amoled display, 125w charger and battery backup and many more.  Cons- No audio jack external DAC audio is supported with a type C connector. Sd card support is not available and can still be used for external storage with a type C connector.  Talking about the camera - The camera takes the natural picture exactly the same as what you see, natural colour production. Manual auto focus has some problems but auto auto focus is great. 200mp photos give more details in the image. The camera has only 16x zoom and 16x zoom is noisy. Macro and wide angle are great. Portrait image some time over blur but captures pics like mini dslr.  Conclusion - Great phone to buy under 40k still this phone bets major flagship phone under specs. In smart prix specs score is 93 and that's huge. With an upgrade this phone is getting way better.\n",

It's worth the Money and I have heard from my friend that android 13 is far far better, smooth and battery life is amazing too. Don't regret leaving Apple (12) and coming back to Android. Thank you moto for keeping this clean\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: There is in-build app lock and dual app. Go to moto secure app and turn on secure folder. Phone is great. Everything is good except camera, my last phone is realme 6 pro. I felt it had better camera. There were no proper updates on my order.  Update - received Android 13 update. Everything has improved. Battery life is unbelievable after, got 9hrs+ of SOT and I still had 15% battery left. after any update phones battery will become even worst but not in this case. Everyone is complaining about updates. they take time, to give bug free upgrade. They nailed it.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Using since 3 days, bought for 41k with exchange  Pros 1 Design - looks and feel premium flagship specially the display  2 Camera - if you know how to use camera to get better output images, then this beat iPhone Camera (Front and back both produced great images, after update to Android 13 low light images improves), otherwise you can go honor 90 for colour boosted images  3 Performance - Good if you are moderate gamer, for heavy gaming (play around 2-3 hours with high graphics and high refresh rate) don't consider, the stock Android feels good with Moto Security apps is bonus, After Android 13 update most of the previous issues resolved  4 Battery - I am moderate user 1 hour gaming, calls and normal browsing get SOT around 6 to 6:30 hour (Refresh rate is Auto), (little heating while charging but no worries as we used 125 watt charger which done 26 min from 10 to 100%)  Cons 1 Updates - Motorola needs to work on timely update otherwise no issues\n",

Smooth UI with no bloatware. I was confused between 11r, 11 and edge 30 ultra. With green line reputation of one plus, i went for this device.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pleasant surprise, i use this as secondary to my iphone 12. Other than the camera, Moto is superior in every other way, especially considering the price.  I was using the S20/S21 Fe series, and after using moto, they seem like utter overpriced money grabs, ultra stable smooth animations and screen guard, great slick case and awesome charger in the box.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this handset since last 10 to 15 days and I would like to say Motorola has done an excellent job this time with this flagship piece.  1. Camera quality improved post installation of Android 13 update 2. Wide angle brings an excellent snap 3. Battery backup is excellent. I use this handset as my primary phone and still it gives 7 to 8 hours of SOT 4. Extremely smooth silky navigation 5. From the design perspective it's pretty good as always with gorilla glass protection at the both side 6. It takes max 25mnts to get full charge from 5% to 100% 7. While plugging in for charging, it's heated up until it becomes 100%\n",

But i had to contend with an unruly delivery executive and was unable to exchange my old phone since the rates quoted were very low.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The product is really amazing. Pros- Camera, processor,clock speed, display,144hz refresh rate, bgmi in 60fps in hd graphics and 90fps in low specs,edge light,chop flash light, curve p amoled display, 125w charger and battery backup and many more.  Cons- No audio jack external DAC audio is supported with a type C connector. Sd card support is not available and can still be used for external storage with a type C connector.  Talking about the camera - The camera takes the natural picture exactly the same as what you see, natural colour production. Manual auto focus has some problems but auto auto focus is great. 200mp photos give more details in the image. The camera has only 16x zoom and 16x zoom is noisy. Macro and wide angle are great. Portrait image some time over blur but captures pics like mini dslr.  Conclusion - Great phone to buy under 40k still this phone bets major flagship phone under specs. In smart prix specs score is 93 and that's huge. With an upgrade this phone is getting way better.\n",

There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones.  Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra.  Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled.  Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones.  This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later.  Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained.  Meditek processor giving smooth experience  Speakers are also good.

There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones.  Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra.  Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled.  Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones.  This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later.  Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained.  Meditek processor giving smooth experience  Speakers are also good.  No Dolby or HDR display on OTTs like Netflix.  Overall value for money.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing this review after a month's use. The only pros that I've experienced on this phone are the superior camera and display quality. But a lot of scope for improvement when it comes to user experience, OS functionality, processor performance, sound quality and battery performance.I've used miui and oxygen OS before, and when it comes to user friendliness, funtouch is still way behind them even at this price range. Definitely not a gaming phone, there are slight lags even when I play very basic games like Alto's Odyssey. So you can imagine what will happen if you're a heavy gamer. A huge letdown when it comes to sound quality as it has mono speaker (at this price range!!). I tried playing the same song on this phone and my old redmi note 9 pro max(which costed 18k), and at full volume note 9 totally overpowered the sound coming out from this device. Sound quality gets better with enhancement options only when you're using your earphones.  Personal Verdict: Go for this phone if the camera and display are your primary attraction, and you want a phone that looks sleek and premium on your hands. Also, I got it at a fair amount of discount (almost 10k), so that helps as a consolation.  NB: Terrible delivery experience, Flipkart took a lifetime to deliver the product as it was an exchange offer.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Just Wow. Camera is mind blowing. This camera centric phone won't allow you to feel that you don't own a DSLR. It is indeed a Pocket- DSLR. It's large curved display is good for multimedia experience. It's Single Speaker is quite louder. Battery will go all day long. The Fast Charger takes around 45 mins to charge fully from 20%. Software experience is also good. Android 14 and Funtouch OS 14 out of the box. The UI is nearly Bloatware free. In Looks and Design, it overshadows other premium phones available in the market in this price range.\n",

Fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work well  At the end : it's a good camera and good performance phone (if u don't have problem with little battery drains)\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I've been using the Vivo V30 Pro for four months, and while its performance is impressive, it tends to overheat during video calls and gaming, which can lead to call drops. The 5000mAh battery doesn't last as long as expected and requires frequent recharges. However, it cools down quickly once the intensive activity stops. On the bright side, the camera quality is excellent, capturing DSLR-like photos with vibrant colors and sharp details.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing this review after a month's use. The only pros that I've experienced on this phone are the superior camera and display quality. But a lot of scope for improvement when it comes to user experience, OS functionality, processor performance, sound quality and battery performance.I've used miui and oxygen OS before, and when it comes to user friendliness, funtouch is still way behind them even at this price range. Definitely not a gaming phone, there are slight lags even when I play very basic games like Alto's Odyssey. So you can imagine what will happen if you're a heavy gamer. A huge letdown when it comes to sound quality as it has mono speaker (at this price range!!). I tried playing the same song on this phone and my old redmi note 9 pro max(which costed 18k), and at full volume note 9 totally overpowered the sound coming out from this device. Sound quality gets better with enhancement options only when you're using your earphones.  Personal Verdict: Go for this phone if the camera and display are your primary attraction, and you want a phone that looks sleek and premium on your hands. Also, I got it at a fair amount of discount (almost 10k), so that helps as a consolation.  NB: Terrible delivery experience, Flipkart took a lifetime to deliver the product as it was an exchange offer.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Just Wow. Camera is mind blowing. This camera centric phone won't allow you to feel that you don't own a DSLR. It is indeed a Pocket- DSLR. It's large curved display is good for multimedia experience. It's Single Speaker is quite louder. Battery will go all day long. The Fast Charger takes around 45 mins to charge fully from 20%. Software experience is also good. Android 14 and Funtouch OS 14 out of the box. The UI is nearly Bloatware free. In Looks and Design, it overshadows other premium phones available in the market in this price range.\n",

Motion is taken care of...  BUT, BUT honestly - ...it has a heating issue... Maybe, just with mine... Just 3 minutes of recording Video and I could feel as though my palms are on fire.  I am not a gamer but I do love editing and making videos. Perhaps wrong choice but I didn't expect this issue at this price range\n",

This phone captures some really great pictures and the aura light feature is also very helpful. Overall a good deal\n",

Aura light do its job very well and differentiate it from all other phones which is available in this price range. U can definately go for it because there was no other phone available which gives this type of premium feel.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's Been 42 Hrs of Using this Profession portrait phone. So what's my Opinion So I have shifted to new phone after 3 years by using Realme 7 pro which was an perfect device at that time and Now I think this is much better  Bcoz It has 2 Sony IMX sensor and and Small useful camera And front is also an 50Mp AF camera Which is Best.  So many people may have their own opinion. But my suggestion is that...if u care your phone very nicely and you don't have any issues with 3D curved display then u can surely go for it.   There will be both Positive and Negative things about this . But bcoz of some negative reviews This Phone doest loose this impression.  I know it has single speaker but other things which is Given is worthy for 36k after bank discount.  So...It's your choice and taste .... Photos are amazing at first snap After editing I cannot guess is this an image from Phone? So below I have attached.   Charging is also nice Battery gives aramse.... Around 8hrs  But if u use camera more then it will drain because it need more Power  Heating is not see till now..  Gaming: Yup it's an....it's powered with 8200 so obviously used in May gaming phones    Compared to v27 pro thiz is more and more better and improved one I can say...   Back is made up of glass and side frame looks like metal.. Typing sensitivity is very good 😊   Thanks for Reading till here\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: First thing first,  Display (5/5): It's really really good. Its vibrant, feels fluid, excellent viewing angles and very bright even under direct sunlight.  Performance (4/5): The phone feels fluid when opening apps, browsing through UI. I'm not a gamer tho  Camera (4.5/5): The main camera is very good. Takes good photos and portraits. The 2X telephoto lens is decent for clicking portraits but not as good as main camera ( The resolution could have been better). Ultrawide camera is just okay for occasional clicking.  Battery (2/5): Battery backup is not good. Drains so fast even when doing very light tasks. Ideal drain is also quite high for some reason. Although the charging speed is very fast and replenishes the juice at 80 watts.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Vivo has yet another premium midranger in its ranks, one produced in India and with a design inspired by India - the vivo V29 Pro. Like previous V-series models, the V29 Pro heavily focuses on photography. The V29 Pro doubles down on the previous model's 'Aura light' concept with a dedicated color-changing illuminator on the back, introduces a dedicated portrait telephoto camera and brings an extra high-res display into the mix.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Superb phone. The only downside was the battery performance as it doesn't seem to last even a day even for normal usage\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a very good product at this price range.Vivo is known for camera but it is a very balanced phone.Though i am disappointed with the slow charging.It take an hour for 99.Single speaker is for sure another negative point.The design is good but at this price a leather back could be much better or atleast it should not be this slippery.The camera is way too big.Design could be better .  Conclusion -If you want a great camera phone with no lag gaming and u can charge your phone atleast once a day (if you dont spend your whole day playing), then u can go for it. If your preference is gaming then iqoo neo 7 pro is much cheaper and better. If your prefer gaming and quite good camera then go for one plus 11r.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Coming to the first and foremost point here Camera is outstanding. Details below:  Pros- The camera came out totally unexpected and photos and videos are almost at par with flagship level. Battery and display is also pretty good. Expected some more raw performance from the processor. Should have opted for Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1. Aura light is really meaningful.  Cons- The speaker is bad. At 40k stereo speaker is a bare minimum nowadays. Atleast Vivo should have provided a better quality monospeaker. 3.5mm jack is dearly missed here. Expected some better features in UI since coming from Realme UI. Anyways, Vivo update policy for this phone is totally crime. For a phone at this price point 3+4yrs software support is required.  Hope this helps !!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: It's 2nd time I choose Vivo and as expected it's a perfect choice for photography. (1) Primary Camera is superb with Sony sensor. (2) I just love it's 12MP telephoto portrait lense. Perfact edge detection with cool blurry background. Aura light makes a huge difference in portrait clicks especially in low light conditions. (3) 8MP ultra wide lense is just average. Not that useful. (4) Video recording quality is decent with OIS. (5) 50MP Selfie Camera is outstanding in this segment. (6) Battery life is decent, It can last for whole day. It takes around 40 to 45 mins for 0 to 100% with 80 Watt charger. (7) Mono speaker is not acceptable at this price segment.  Overall it's a phone for photography lovers. Very slim and light weight. Vivo should give a decent back cover with such an expensive phone. Provided transparent back cover is average in quality.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Pros-  Camera are like DSLR .This phone gives the best camera - 5/5  Heat - Nice heat control, I didn't feel heat after a long use - 5/5  Design - Design and in hand feel are of top level.

It gives best display there were no lag in 4k video playing -5/5  Battery should be 5000 mah - 4/5  Cons-  Performance could be more better - 4/5.  Built and water proof - They should use gorilla glass protection Both side, and Should give IP67 rating - 3/5  Speaker - It has mono speaker which are quite good but stereo should be the better option - 4/5  Haptic are too bad feels like 10k phone -2/5  Charging - They mentioned 80W but It charge 0-100% in 70-77min -3/5  UI - It's smooth but there are few Preloaded apps- 4/5  Software update - There will be 2 OS and 3 year sequrity update. I think if a person is buying such a price phone It should get atleast 3 year of OS update- 3/5  Overall 3.8\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: First thing first,  Display (5/5): It's really really good. Its vibrant, feels fluid, excellent viewing angles and very bright even under direct sunlight.  Performance (4/5): The phone feels fluid when opening apps, browsing through UI. I'm not a gamer tho  Camera (4.5/5): The main camera is very good. Takes good photos and portraits. The 2X telephoto lens is decent for clicking portraits but not as good as main camera ( The resolution could have been better). Ultrawide camera is just okay for occasional clicking.  Battery (2/5): Battery backup is not good. Drains so fast even when doing very light tasks. Ideal drain is also quite high for some reason. Although the charging speed is very fast and replenishes the juice at 80 watts.\n",

Pros - Camera Display Multimedia experience Performance Very light weight  Cons- Battery is slightly low as compared to competitors Single speaker. At this price we expect stereo speakers\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Vivo has yet another premium midranger in its ranks, one produced in India and with a design inspired by India - the vivo V29 Pro. Like previous V-series models, the V29 Pro heavily focuses on photography. The V29 Pro doubles down on the previous model's 'Aura light' concept with a dedicated color-changing illuminator on the back, introduces a dedicated portrait telephoto camera and brings an extra high-res display into the mix.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Superb phone. The only downside was the battery performance as it doesn't seem to last even a day even for normal usage\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall it's a very good product at this price range.Vivo is known for camera but it is a very balanced phone.Though i am disappointed with the slow charging.It take an hour for 99.Single speaker is for sure another negative point.The design is good but at this price a leather back could be much better or atleast it should not be this slippery.The camera is way too big.Design could be better .  Conclusion -If you want a great camera phone with no lag gaming and u can charge your phone atleast once a day (if you dont spend your whole day playing), then u can go for it. If your preference is gaming then iqoo neo 7 pro is much cheaper and better. If your prefer gaming and quite good camera then go for one plus 11r.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome, all rounder mobile for daily use\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Coming to the first and foremost point here Camera is outstanding. Details below:  Pros- The camera came out totally unexpected and photos and videos are almost at par with flagship level. Battery and display is also pretty good. Expected some more raw performance from the processor. Should have opted for Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1. Aura light is really meaningful.  Cons- The speaker is bad. At 40k stereo speaker is a bare minimum nowadays. Atleast Vivo should have provided a better quality monospeaker. 3.5mm jack is dearly missed here. Expected some better features in UI since coming from Realme UI. Anyways, Vivo update policy for this phone is totally crime. For a phone at this price point 3+4yrs software support is required.  Hope this helps !!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice product camera nice looking very nice\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's 2nd time I choose Vivo and as expected it's a perfect choice for photography. (1) Primary Camera is superb with Sony sensor. (2) I just love it's 12MP telephoto portrait lense. Perfact edge detection with cool blurry background. Aura light makes a huge difference in portrait clicks especially in low light conditions. (3) 8MP ultra wide lense is just average. Not that useful. (4) Video recording quality is decent with OIS. (5) 50MP Selfie Camera is outstanding in this segment. (6) Battery life is decent, It can last for whole day. It takes around 40 to 45 mins for 0 to 100% with 80 Watt charger. (7) Mono speaker is not acceptable at this price segment.  Overall it's a phone for photography lovers. Very slim and light weight. Vivo should give a decent back cover with such an expensive phone. Provided transparent back cover is average in quality.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Pros-  Camera are like DSLR .This phone gives the best camera - 5/5  Heat - Nice heat control, I didn't feel heat after a long use - 5/5  Design - Design and in hand feel are of top level. I think there should be 1 more colours option - 4/5   Display is awesome, I loved it . It gives best display there were no lag in 4k video playing -5/5  Battery should be 5000 mah - 4/5  Cons-  Performance could be more better - 4/5.  Built and water proof - They should use gorilla glass protection Both side, and Should give IP67 rating - 3/5  Speaker - It has mono speaker which are quite good but stereo should be the better option - 4/5  Haptic are too bad feels like 10k phone -2/5  Charging - They mentioned 80W but It charge 0-100% in 70-77min -3/5  UI - It's smooth but there are few Preloaded apps- 4/5  Software update - There will be 2 OS and 3 year sequrity update. I think if a person is buying such a price phone It should get atleast 3 year of OS update- 3/5  Overall 3.8\n",

In this price is a honest cutting from vivo. 2. Full of bloatwares, some significant effort a person needs to make all bloat apps uninstalled or permissions turned off.  Positives: 1. Camera, very well. Even hopeless 2MP macro lens did its job well. 2. 5g speed is good, got around 1.5Gbs with Jio 3. Display is good and bright, using in outdoors\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using this for last 1week, So far very positive. Let's discuss the negatives first: 1. Speaker is loud, good quality but not stereo. In this price is a honest cutting from vivo. 2. Full of bloatwares, some significant effort a person needs to make all bloat apps uninstalled or permissions turned off.  Positives: 1. Camera, very well. Even hopeless 2MP macro lens did its job well. 2. 5g speed is good, got around 1.5Gbs with Jio 3. Display is good and bright, using in outdoors\n",

It's camera is fantastic 😻 Ear speaker, mic, speaker really nice. It's performance is also good. As it's 5G handset, internet speed is quite impressive. I got 20mb++/second during downloading with 4G data pack.  Main issue with Battery 🔋 drain so fast... Battery is the biggest concern for me now. To get tempered glass for curve display seems too difficult BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ISSUE Overall very nice.  Thank you!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Dear Reader  I bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues. So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand. It has been a few days since I have been using this phone. I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good. The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate. The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah. Charging is quite fast. The camera is good and serves the purpose pretty well. I'm not a gamer but i can say the gamer won't be that disappointed. One issue i notice is that this phone comes with a few bloat ware which u can uninstall. When you make carrier video calling have noticed a few issue.Might get addresses in the next update. In one word you won't be disappointed. It is but pricey but with exchange if you get this phone by 20k to 25k this tat is a good deal.\n",

There is no responsibility to anyone in flipkart. The phone is good in looks. It's just a day I have used this phone. So far it seems ok. Pros: 1. Looks are good 2. Built is good but the plastic frame makes the phone delicate 3. Cameras are good 4. Battery seems ok but not yet tested 5. Connectivity is good 6. Charging is fast Cons: 1. No memory card slot 2. Changing color as claimed by vivo is taking too much time. I have kept my phone in sunlight for more than 15min and still there is no change of color. 3. No automatic dark mode option available 4. Lots of bugs sometime slows the phone 5. Feels costly if we look at the features offered 6. Vivo has not announce how many updates they will give. Overall the phone is ok. It's only hype created by Vivo. I have given three stars all for phone. Flipkart services is very bad. I have to go and collect the phone. They have delayed delivery by 3 days and finally I have to go and get my phone or else God knows when I would have got it. They also have messed up with my payment even after completing the payment they have shown it as outstanding for 6 months. I am still suffering from that because of changes in my credit score\n",

My previous OnePlus Nord had a relatively Loud Speaker than this, but it's Okay as the Camera and Smooth Performance of the Phone Covers it up.  This is my very first Phone from Vivo, uptill now things are Pretty good as it's only a Week, let's see how does it fares in the Long Run.\n",

This price point they should at least give us 55 w charger But what we getting is 44 watt charger it will take 70 minutes to fully charge your phone. That's little bit disappointed because I use many phones like IQOO 7 legend and some other phones they will take only 45 to 50 minutes TO full charged the phone..\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: First of all some background. I have been a Oneplus 5T user for close to 3.5 years now, even today I love the camera and other features especially the OS of that phone. When I started getting HW issues in that phone, went for a iPhone 11 which was pathetic in all aspects including camera, fone usability, user friendliness etc. So sold off the iPhone 11 in just 6 months Was looking for a good Android phone with better camera than OP 5T, better battery life, better display etc  X70 Pro didn't disappoint at all in all these aspects during my usage of last 2 weeks Camera is really wonderful, main camera, wide angle, Night mode are all really amazing Display, I am a big fan of curved display, and watching movies on it certainly feels good and gives a premium look to the phone Battery life - I am not a gamer. However I do use it throughout the day for browsing, calls etc and easily the battery life comes to 1.5 days with such usage including an hour or two of watching videos etc Phone is a bit bulky compared to my old phones but with the larger battery it is understandable Holding the phone, back cover, finger print and face detection etc works fine  What could be better - Battery charging speed is definitely not like the 65W charging that you get with many phones these days. It took 65 mins to be precise for charging from 15% to 100% which is not Superfast Speakers - I have seen reviews about the lack of stereo speakers etc but it's still loud. However the quality of audio doesn't feel that premium - feels a bit like on cheaper fones Cost could have been slightly lesser given all the points above I didn't find a great difference when it comes to 120 Hz display compared to old OP 5T display from a scrolling pov, but have set it to Automatic, so not sure if it's because of this setting  But overall it is a Great phone with very good camera, Superb curved display and usability I wouldn't call it Value for money though due to the other points mentioned above\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The fone is good but nowhere near the price it commands or the Samsung fones in terms of software optimization and ease of operations or various extras the Samsung UI provides. The fun touch OS is not smooth, it's riddled with bugs and basic mods to harness the best out of Android 11 are missing. No edge lighting which even oppo fones provide these days. No notification led on screen top. Wallpapers are mostly paid in vivo collection. Vibration has no options for short n long vibrating notifications. Even the haptic feedback is negligible. No keypads other than Gboard n Google voice type. No sound for key touch feedback. Basically the premium feel is missing here despite a robust hardware combination. It's all about the experience in a smartfone and that is what precisely is missing here in x70 pro. My 4 yr old samsung s9 plus 6gb ram 256 gb is more vibrant in display n options than this one. It's more buttery smooth too than x70 pro with half the Ram, just because of software optimization. Basic shortcuts and customisation options are missing. Vivo hasn't done the homework well here. Also the box in which the package came ( brown flipkart box) was torn off when I took the delivery, god knows what the delivery guy did with it.  Update after 3 months usage: keypad is very slow and mistypes if one types speedily. Phone hangs alot in simple tripadvisor application. Camera takes years to open up. Absolutly poor hardware and software combination. It cnt even catch my home wifi properly when all other devices are running fine on it. Absolute waste of money, dnt buy it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Design and build:-  Slim and lightweight Great aesthetics No headphone jack  As usual, Vivo has produced an extremely premium and eye-catching handset. It may be ever so slightly denser and heavier than its predecessor – at 7.99mm thick and with a weight of 183g – but it feels lightweight and is extremely slim for slipping in pockets.   Display and audio:-  120Hz AMOLED display Full HD+ panel Unimpressive speakers 240hz touch sampling rate  It’s not a truly dynamic refresh rate, as it can only switch between 60Hz and 120Hz, and not anything else in-between. That said, the power-saving capabilities are still excellent, even when you use it at a higher refresh rate.  Camera:-  Excellent quad-camera setup Great zoom capabilities HDR enhancement is sometimes iffy  It’s made up of four lenses: a 50Mp main lens with an f/1.75 aperture, a Sony IMX766V sensor complete with Vivo's Gimbal Stabilisation 3.0, a 12Mp ultrawide lens with an f/2.2 aperture, a 12Mp 2x telephoto lens with an f/1.98 aperture and an 8Mp 5x periscope lens with an f/3.4 aperture.  On the front, there's a 32Mp selfie camera with an f/2.45 aperture. All the lenses are engineered with ZEISS optics too.  Battery life:-  Nealy two days of real-world use 44W fast-charging   End of last  Vivo X70 Pro Pros and Cons PROS. CONS AMOLED 120Hz Refresh Rate Bit Pricey Great Camera Implementation. MediaTek Dimensity 1200 SoC Gimble Camera System. Only 4 5G Bands 44W fast charging support No 3.5mm Audio Jack Solid Build Quality. No Micro-SD Card Slot Bright Display Comes with tons of Pre-Installed Apps Single Speaker NFC Support OIS on Three Lenses\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Review after using 15 days.  1. Camera Camera is super duper, in low light it become a super i never seen before such kind of images in night, I before used Samsung phones but in dark and low light samsung produce black images and unable to capture more lights in this segment vivo has done better job colour accuracy is decent main camera has big sensor size so you can enjoy depth of feel without using portrait mode and capture more detail images. Telephoto camera is much unique and capturing decent photos edge detection is next level and applying some beauty mode on face but look wise its nice to see you can say it its mini DSLR, Zeiss has done better job with Vivo and producing decent images with some Zeiss mode of portrait, ultrawide and periscope lense are also performing best. Front camera is also good. 2.Display Much brighter display you can see clearly in direct sun light and colours are punchy size is big but we can handle easily this is amoled display and video and pictures are looking awesome but colours are not as Samsung produce. 3.Performance Customised Dimencity 1200 with Vivo gives 700000 Antutu score is not a less any flagship phone produce, day to day task you can handle easily its not as good as Snapdragon 865 and 870 but you never disappoint with it gives you constant performance and never heat more small heating is ignorable and battery 🔋 can take easily with day with it that samsungs Exynos never done. 5.Battery Battery gives you 5 to 6 hours display on time on heavy usages and 7 to 8 hours moderate usages you can get whole day with it when I came back to home its remaining 60 to 70 percent.  6. UI Funtouch UI is near to stock android and gives you smooth experience much better than previous some bloatware you can find in it but easily removable.  Cons. I found some issues when time getting portrait photos by Telephoto lense portrait effect is not applying in most of cases I think this is software issue and will be resolved in future updates.  By the way this is camera phone not for heavy gamers but moderate gamer can also go on it it fadu phone and I am happy and satisfied for terrific purchase. Thanks\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's already been 40+ days using this phone. The greatest highlight of this phone (as i hope everyone already knows) being it's camera. The phone is a great buy if your priority is camera. You'd be delighted to use it's camera. The portrait modes are great. Battery performance is decent too. You get around 8 hours screen on time on a mixed usage. You get more than 10 hours screen on time if you're watching movies offline. But at this price point it cuts short many features which competitors offer in this segment. Like an IP rating, wireless charging, stereo speakers. But since I'm a camera enthusiast, i don't bother about skipping these features as long as i get the best camera experience. So i think this smartphone is made for a whole different category of buyers for whom this device is a no brainer purchase at this price point too. Attaching few camera samples.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera is very good. Overall good phone.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Excellent Phone. I own the 8Gb 256Gb variant. This is by far one to the best phones that I have owned. I have moved from OnePlus 7T to this device and I am very happy having made this decision. I have used Flagship devices of Samsung, Asus and OnePlus in the past but this device has excelled in the camera department way above all of those. My wife has OnePlus 9R but there is no comparison of camera among the two. Even oneplus 9 pro and iphone 12 pro max are sometimes lacking behind the camera performance of this device. Video recording with ultra stabilization is like a dream and matched the professional video quality. It also does 4K at 60fps. Night photography is beyond amazing. Telephoto zoom is unbelievable, flipkart doesn't allow me to add more than 5 images else I would have depicted the zoom capability of this phone with more clarity. Zeiss additions to images make portraits look amazing. I personally feel they could improve here and keep beauty filters to mostly natural, thou one can tweak it in settings. Sometimes photos take a while after clicking to be processed but that's acceptable. People have sometimes asked me that what digital camera or DSLR have I used for some of the superb portraits taken by this phone. Performance wise Dimensity 1200 vivo excels in all parts be it multitasking or heavy gaming, phone heats only slightly to feel warm. Display and video is also flagship level and curved display feels like endless infinity screen. Battery life of any phone would feel like that it could be better but vivo has done good job in maintaining a steady battery life. It easily passes a day with moderate to heavy usage and I get SOT of 4 to 6 hours (avg 5 hours) easily on big display with 120Hz refresh rates. This phone has a mono speaker at bottom but that's acceptable to me as it more than does the job. Overall I am very happy with this phone as my main motive of photography and also good battery life bundled with flagship performance are ticked and excelled by the phone.\n",

The E5 Curved Amoled 120hz display is amazing 👌🏻 The main highlight of this phone is its cameras and they have really done a excellent job in this area.

Rear camera has Laser Auto focus. All the lens are Coated with Zeiss T* which emits light Glare. Zeiss and Vivo partnership is by far the best one in smartphone camera tuning. Apart from this the Processor is a powerful one (MTK Dimensity 1200 V) that is customized by vivo so there are no lags or stutters in the usage. Battery backup is really good 👌🏻 Charging time is fast as well! It has an IR blaster which is a nice addition to have.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I can say that it is a dslr with smart phone features. The only disappointing thing from Flipkart is that the phone exchange is just a sham. They drastically slash the price of the phone and that's too bad.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Thank you Flipkart for delivering the product on time  Now about the product. Since you all know this is all about camera smartphone. The camera is simply awesome and actually does the job as claimed by the brand. Few attached images for reference. Still if you have any doubt, I would suggest you to visit your nearby stores to check yourself. Now apart from camera the processor is not very powerful but it is very stable and can handle almost everything. This is NOT a GAMING SMARTPHONE. However, I have played cod and asphalt 8&9 on max settings and it runs very smoothly. I do play games but am not a hardcore gamer. The OS is good and is highly customisable. The charger is fast and does the job perfectly. And lastly, one will get amazed with the design of the smartphone, it really feels premium.  I can surely recommend this smartphone to the people who are NOT hardcore gamers and want a premium smartphone which will do all the daily tasks very fast and smoothly with a good battery life and an exceptional camera.  Please do your research before spending since it is your hard earned money and purchase as per your requirement.  Thank you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Display is not good as MI 11X or 11X pro. If you need best display experience please go for MI 11 X. This phone has latest E5 super amoled but VIVO has not customised this to look super or extra vibrant. But everyone knows why anyone will go for this device, Camera is awesome, totally replaced DSLR portraits but portraits doesn't work in night lighting conditions. In day light It does click best portraits photography, colour comes up so vibrants. Still in review but if you want a DSLR camera in phone, go for it, better than iphone or any other samsung or one pluse premium device when it comes to photography. Attached few sample shots\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Masterpiece from Vivo.!!! If you are an android lover and want a true flagship experience then this phone is for you. I am a photography enthusiast and take many photos using my phone. This phone is foremost as far as camera is concerned. You are getting DSLR Camera in phone. True flagship experience but Vivo need to develop it's own custom dialer rather than buggy Google dialer which is hated by maximum people. If you are wondering to buy any phone under 50K then go for it without thinking twice.  Pros: Display 10/10 Software: 09/10 (funtouch need update) Speed: 10/10 Rear camera: 10/10 Cons: Battery: 05/10 (should have 5000mah) Charger: 06/10 (should have 65w) No OIS on front camer\n",

Audio quality through Samsung galaxy buds plus is very good. Rich Retail box with all the accessories.  Improvement areas- Typing haptic feedback is the weakest part of this phone though vibration on call is good.

Battery easily lasts for a day on normal usage.  Performance is upto the mark, dimensity 1200 does good job. Previously was using SNAPDRAGON , no difference in performances.  UI is good and responsive.  Refresh rate is butter smooth.  There are many customisation options u ll love it.  Call quality very good.  Phone speakers are just about good.  Display is awesome and the curved edges gives u a premium feel.  Overall slim and very light to hold.  Overall satisfied with this phone.  Just for your information I was a long term OnePlus 6 user, wanted a new phone , chose this over OnePlus 9/9 Pro, Iphone 12/13.  Main focus was on camera quality, it's an absolute Beauty in this regards. It doesn't means it lags in other departments, it's a overall package. Gonna use this for another 3-4 years untill security updates stop.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Bought this as a replacement for my 2.5 years old Reno 10x zoom which had one of the best cameras... My observations are personal and in brief:  Negatives: × UI is not as polished as Oxygen OS or Oppo's ColorOS × In low light conditions, the camera sometimes fails to take a good snap and comes up with something like a vga camera image × UI lags sometimes while scrolling through app list × You meed to manually switch to different modes in the camera to get the best results × A noticable lag is observed while viewing the photo after taking a snap due to post processing. Post processing itself is sometimes so aggressive that the picture ends up like burnt. × Vivo failed to stick to their timeline of providing Android 12 based funtouchOS update for the phone. × Charging time is almost an hour × Noticed some lag while playing full hd or 4k videos initially × Mono speakers on a flagship device. It's loud but you will feel the difference from a stereo one. What was Vivo thinking?  Most of the above negatives can be fixed with a software update...  Positives: ✓ Everything about this phone is camera, camera and camera and it is really able to perform upto it's hype. Portraits are DSLR like. Supermoon produces detailed moon pictures. Moon picture taken with 60x zoom. Night mode takes photography to another level. Notice the stars. ✓ Video with Ultra Stabilization On takes awesome gimbal like stabilized videos. ✓ No bloatware or ads in UI ✓ Phone is a little less than 6.6 inch and this make it perfectly balanced to hold or keep in pocket ✓ Display is a beauty. Readability even under the harshest sunlight is adequate. Viewing videos on this device ID a pleasure. ✓ 3 major Android upgrades promised by Vivo ✓ Build quality is pretty solid. Aurora Dawn colour is eyecatching.  Overall to summarise the review, i would say that if you a photography lover do go for this without a doubt. The photography on this phone is on another level. Don't bother about the SoC, Dimensity 1200 is more than enough to handle your day to day work and some gaming ...\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: First of all some background. I have been a Oneplus 5T user for close to 3.5 years now, even today I love the camera and other features especially the OS of that phone. When I started getting HW issues in that phone, went for a iPhone 11 which was pathetic in all aspects including camera, fone usability, user friendliness etc. So sold off the iPhone 11 in just 6 months Was looking for a good Android phone with better camera than OP 5T, better battery life, better display etc  X70 Pro didn't disappoint at all in all these aspects during my usage of last 2 weeks Camera is really wonderful, main camera, wide angle, Night mode are all really amazing Display, I am a big fan of curved display, and watching movies on it certainly feels good and gives a premium look to the phone Battery life - I am not a gamer. However I do use it throughout the day for browsing, calls etc and easily the battery life comes to 1.5 days with such usage including an hour or two of watching videos etc Phone is a bit bulky compared to my old phones but with the larger battery it is understandable Holding the phone, back cover, finger print and face detection etc works fine  What could be better - Battery charging speed is definitely not like the 65W charging that you get with many phones these days. It took 65 mins to be precise for charging from 15% to 100% which is not Superfast Speakers - I have seen reviews about the lack of stereo speakers etc but it's still loud. However the quality of audio doesn't feel that premium - feels a bit like on cheaper fones Cost could have been slightly lesser given all the points above I didn't find a great difference when it comes to 120 Hz display compared to old OP 5T display from a scrolling pov, but have set it to Automatic, so not sure if it's because of this setting  But overall it is a Great phone with very good camera, Superb curved display and usability I wouldn't call it Value for money though due to the other points mentioned above\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The fone is good but nowhere near the price it commands or the Samsung fones in terms of software optimization and ease of operations or various extras the Samsung UI provides. The fun touch OS is not smooth, it's riddled with bugs and basic mods to harness the best out of Android 11 are missing. No edge lighting which even oppo fones provide these days. No notification led on screen top. Wallpapers are mostly paid in vivo collection. Vibration has no options for short n long vibrating notifications. Even the haptic feedback is negligible. No keypads other than Gboard n Google voice type. No sound for key touch feedback. Basically the premium feel is missing here despite a robust hardware combination. It's all about the experience in a smartfone and that is what precisely is missing here in x70 pro. My 4 yr old samsung s9 plus 6gb ram 256 gb is more vibrant in display n options than this one. It's more buttery smooth too than x70 pro with half the Ram, just because of software optimization. Basic shortcuts and customisation options are missing. Vivo hasn't done the homework well here. Also the box in which the package came ( brown flipkart box) was torn off when I took the delivery, god knows what the delivery guy did with it.  Update after 3 months usage: keypad is very slow and mistypes if one types speedily. Phone hangs alot in simple tripadvisor application. Camera takes years to open up. Absolutly poor hardware and software combination. It cnt even catch my home wifi properly when all other devices are running fine on it. Absolute waste of money, dnt buy it.\n",

I think most Snapdragon lovers got confusion about Mediatek dim 1200 that same I got..but don't worry this chip is developed by Mediatek and coordinated with vivo team..this team take over the dim 1200 and make efficiency changes according to their needs..however dim 1200 is already a decent chip too.. Finally this cam has Zeiss colour science that delivers the rich photography experience.. If your needs and budget permits, you can go for this without second thought..\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Design and build:-  Slim and lightweight Great aesthetics No headphone jack  As usual, Vivo has produced an extremely premium and eye-catching handset. It may be ever so slightly denser and heavier than its predecessor – at 7.99mm thick and with a weight of 183g – but it feels lightweight and is extremely slim for slipping in pockets.   Display and audio:-  120Hz AMOLED display Full HD+ panel Unimpressive speakers 240hz touch sampling rate  It’s not a truly dynamic refresh rate, as it can only switch between 60Hz and 120Hz, and not anything else in-between. That said, the power-saving capabilities are still excellent, even when you use it at a higher refresh rate.  Camera:-  Excellent quad-camera setup Great zoom capabilities HDR enhancement is sometimes iffy  It’s made up of four lenses: a 50Mp main lens with an f/1.75 aperture, a Sony IMX766V sensor complete with Vivo's Gimbal Stabilisation 3.0, a 12Mp ultrawide lens with an f/2.2 aperture, a 12Mp 2x telephoto lens with an f/1.98 aperture and an 8Mp 5x periscope lens with an f/3.4 aperture.  On the front, there's a 32Mp selfie camera with an f/2.45 aperture. All the lenses are engineered with ZEISS optics too.  Battery life:-  Nealy two days of real-world use 44W fast-charging   End of last  Vivo X70 Pro Pros and Cons PROS. CONS AMOLED 120Hz Refresh Rate Bit Pricey Great Camera Implementation. MediaTek Dimensity 1200 SoC Gimble Camera System. Only 4 5G Bands 44W fast charging support No 3.5mm Audio Jack Solid Build Quality. No Micro-SD Card Slot Bright Display Comes with tons of Pre-Installed Apps Single Speaker NFC Support OIS on Three Lenses\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Review after using 15 days.  1. Camera Camera is super duper, in low light it become a super i never seen before such kind of images in night, I before used Samsung phones but in dark and low light samsung produce black images and unable to capture more lights in this segment vivo has done better job colour accuracy is decent main camera has big sensor size so you can enjoy depth of feel without using portrait mode and capture more detail images. Telephoto camera is much unique and capturing decent photos edge detection is next level and applying some beauty mode on face but look wise its nice to see you can say it its mini DSLR, Zeiss has done better job with Vivo and producing decent images with some Zeiss mode of portrait, ultrawide and periscope lense are also performing best. Front camera is also good. 2.Display Much brighter display you can see clearly in direct sun light and colours are punchy size is big but we can handle easily this is amoled display and video and pictures are looking awesome but colours are not as Samsung produce. 3.Performance Customised Dimencity 1200 with Vivo gives 700000 Antutu score is not a less any flagship phone produce, day to day task you can handle easily its not as good as Snapdragon 865 and 870 but you never disappoint with it gives you constant performance and never heat more small heating is ignorable and battery 🔋 can take easily with day with it that samsungs Exynos never done. 5.Battery Battery gives you 5 to 6 hours display on time on heavy usages and 7 to 8 hours moderate usages you can get whole day with it when I came back to home its remaining 60 to 70 percent.  6. UI Funtouch UI is near to stock android and gives you smooth experience much better than previous some bloatware you can find in it but easily removable.  Cons. I found some issues when time getting portrait photos by Telephoto lense portrait effect is not applying in most of cases I think this is software issue and will be resolved in future updates.  By the way this is camera phone not for heavy gamers but moderate gamer can also go on it it fadu phone and I am happy and satisfied for terrific purchase. Thanks\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's a completely true flagship phone from Vivo despite not having the latest Qualcomm chip. I m using it from last 10 days and I couldn't able to find anything glitchy or sub standard in this smartphone. The real game changer is the Zeiss camera, takes outstanding low light snaps. Touch is super responsive n smooth.\n",

One of the Good Camera phone on this budget.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's already been 40+ days using this phone. The greatest highlight of this phone (as i hope everyone already knows) being it's camera. The phone is a great buy if your priority is camera. You'd be delighted to use it's camera. The portrait modes are great. Battery performance is decent too. You get around 8 hours screen on time on a mixed usage. You get more than 10 hours screen on time if you're watching movies offline. But at this price point it cuts short many features which competitors offer in this segment. Like an IP rating, wireless charging, stereo speakers. But since I'm a camera enthusiast, i don't bother about skipping these features as long as i get the best camera experience. So i think this smartphone is made for a whole different category of buyers for whom this device is a no brainer purchase at this price point too. Attaching few camera samples.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Camera is very good. Overall good phone.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Excellent Phone. I own the 8Gb 256Gb variant. This is by far one to the best phones that I have owned. I have moved from OnePlus 7T to this device and I am very happy having made this decision. I have used Flagship devices of Samsung, Asus and OnePlus in the past but this device has excelled in the camera department way above all of those. My wife has OnePlus 9R but there is no comparison of camera among the two. Even oneplus 9 pro and iphone 12 pro max are sometimes lacking behind the camera performance of this device. Video recording with ultra stabilization is like a dream and matched the professional video quality. It also does 4K at 60fps. Night photography is beyond amazing. Telephoto zoom is unbelievable, flipkart doesn't allow me to add more than 5 images else I would have depicted the zoom capability of this phone with more clarity. Zeiss additions to images make portraits look amazing. I personally feel they could improve here and keep beauty filters to mostly natural, thou one can tweak it in settings. Sometimes photos take a while after clicking to be processed but that's acceptable. People have sometimes asked me that what digital camera or DSLR have I used for some of the superb portraits taken by this phone. Performance wise Dimensity 1200 vivo excels in all parts be it multitasking or heavy gaming, phone heats only slightly to feel warm. Display and video is also flagship level and curved display feels like endless infinity screen. Battery life of any phone would feel like that it could be better but vivo has done good job in maintaining a steady battery life. It easily passes a day with moderate to heavy usage and I get SOT of 4 to 6 hours (avg 5 hours) easily on big display with 120Hz refresh rates. This phone has a mono speaker at bottom but that's acceptable to me as it more than does the job. Overall I am very happy with this phone as my main motive of photography and also good battery life bundled with flagship performance are ticked and excelled by the phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The smartphone looks amazing 👌🏻 it feels premium in hand and is lightweight. The E5 Curved Amoled 120hz display is amazing 👌🏻 The main highlight of this phone is its cameras and they have really done a excellent job in this area. The camera set up is very functional with 50MP Sony Main Lens with 5axis Gimbal Stabilization, 12MP Ultrawide lens with Macro option, 12MP Telephoto Lens for Pro Portraits, 8MP Periscope lens with 60x Zoom and a 32MP Front camera! Rear camera has Laser Auto focus. All the lens are Coated with Zeiss T* which emits light Glare. Zeiss and Vivo partnership is by far the best one in smartphone camera tuning. Apart from this the Processor is a powerful one (MTK Dimensity 1200 V) that is customized by vivo so there are no lags or stutters in the usage. Battery backup is really good 👌🏻 Charging time is fast as well! It has an IR blaster which is a nice addition to have. Overall it's a great device considering its price and the features it's packed with.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I can say that it is a dslr with smart phone features. The only disappointing thing from Flipkart is that the phone exchange is just a sham. They drastically slash the price of the phone and that's too bad.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Thank you Flipkart for delivering the product on time  Now about the product. Since you all know this is all about camera smartphone. The camera is simply awesome and actually does the job as claimed by the brand. Few attached images for reference. Still if you have any doubt, I would suggest you to visit your nearby stores to check yourself. Now apart from camera the processor is not very powerful but it is very stable and can handle almost everything. This is NOT a GAMING SMARTPHONE. However, I have played cod and asphalt 8&9 on max settings and it runs very smoothly. I do play games but am not a hardcore gamer. The OS is good and is highly customisable. The charger is fast and does the job perfectly. And lastly, one will get amazed with the design of the smartphone, it really feels premium.  I can surely recommend this smartphone to the people who are NOT hardcore gamers and want a premium smartphone which will do all the daily tasks very fast and smoothly with a good battery life and an exceptional camera.  Please do your research before spending since it is your hard earned money and purchase as per your requirement.  Thank you.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Display is not good as MI 11X or 11X pro. If you need best display experience please go for MI 11 X. This phone has latest E5 super amoled but VIVO has not customised this to look super or extra vibrant. But everyone knows why anyone will go for this device, Camera is awesome, totally replaced DSLR portraits but portraits doesn't work in night lighting conditions. In day light It does click best portraits photography, colour comes up so vibrants. Still in review but if you want a DSLR camera in phone, go for it, better than iphone or any other samsung or one pluse premium device when it comes to photography. Attached few sample shots\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Masterpiece from Vivo.!!! If you are an android lover and want a true flagship experience then this phone is for you. I am a photography enthusiast and take many photos using my phone. This phone is foremost as far as camera is concerned. You are getting DSLR Camera in phone. True flagship experience but Vivo need to develop it's own custom dialer rather than buggy Google dialer which is hated by maximum people. If you are wondering to buy any phone under 50K then go for it without thinking twice.  Pros: Display 10/10 Software: 09/10 (funtouch need update) Speed: 10/10 Rear camera: 10/10 Cons: Battery: 05/10 (should have 5000mah) Charger: 06/10 (should have 65w) No OIS on front camer\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Brought this over iphone and Oneplus in this sale. Worth the money, best for camera lovers, nice lenses on offer, for zoom shots use tripod to get best shots.  Battery easily lasts for a day on normal usage.  Performance is upto the mark, dimensity 1200 does good job. Previously was using SNAPDRAGON , no difference in performances.  UI is good and responsive.  Refresh rate is butter smooth.  There are many customisation options u ll love it.  Call quality very good.  Phone speakers are just about good.  Display is awesome and the curved edges gives u a premium feel.  Overall slim and very light to hold.  Overall satisfied with this phone.  Just for your information I was a long term OnePlus 6 user, wanted a new phone , chose this over OnePlus 9/9 Pro, Iphone 12/13.  Main focus was on camera quality, it's an absolute Beauty in this regards. It doesn't means it lags in other departments, it's a overall package. Gonna use this for another 3-4 years untill security updates stop.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I'm writing this review after 2months of usage.  Plus + Screen refresh rate is good. Very smooth transition. + Still photos and videos are perfect + Night photography is remarkable. Captures colours and details which are not even visible to bare eyes. + Sound quality is good + Build Quality is good  Minus - Photos of moving objects (makes it hard to capture memorable moments with a baby at home while it keeps running) - Portrait mode not very perfect - Occasional lags observed while multiple apps are being used at a time - Zoom quality is not very remarkable - Cannot use an headphones while the phone is being charged since it doesn't have an audio jack. Though it is good from a safety perspective, it's annoying at times.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I admire Vivo brand, as it is known for innovation and creativity. This is my second phone after V15. X70 pro is very Decent flagship phone with all the industry standard features and accessories (which other brand skip). Photography is top notch 😀, even captures details which are not clear with human eye especially in night mode. No heating issues observed with Average usage and gaming (PUBG NS, Shadow Fight 3,...etc). Last but not the least, we get all the accessories in the box which are discontinued by others.\n",

Value for money and worth buying. Front and back camera is amazing and image quality produced by Zeiss is awesome. Display is mind-blowing. Battery is beast and charges within 40 mins atmost with 44w flash charger. Everything about this phone is just too epic. Overall experience for gaming, photo/video editing, photo/video capturing, a day usage and battery life is just beyond expected.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Bought this as a replacement for my 2.5 years old Reno 10x zoom which had one of the best cameras... My observations are personal and in brief:  Negatives: × UI is not as polished as Oxygen OS or Oppo's ColorOS × In low light conditions, the camera sometimes fails to take a good snap and comes up with something like a vga camera image × UI lags sometimes while scrolling through app list × You meed to manually switch to different modes in the camera to get the best results × A noticable lag is observed while viewing the photo after taking a snap due to post processing. Post processing itself is sometimes so aggressive that the picture ends up like burnt. × Vivo failed to stick to their timeline of providing Android 12 based funtouchOS update for the phone. × Charging time is almost an hour × Noticed some lag while playing full hd or 4k videos initially × Mono speakers on a flagship device. It's loud but you will feel the difference from a stereo one. What was Vivo thinking?  Most of the above negatives can be fixed with a software update...  Positives: ✓ Everything about this phone is camera, camera and camera and it is really able to perform upto it's hype. Portraits are DSLR like. Supermoon produces detailed moon pictures. Moon picture taken with 60x zoom. Night mode takes photography to another level. Notice the stars. ✓ Video with Ultra Stabilization On takes awesome gimbal like stabilized videos. ✓ No bloatware or ads in UI ✓ Phone is a little less than 6.6 inch and this make it perfectly balanced to hold or keep in pocket ✓ Display is a beauty. Readability even under the harshest sunlight is adequate. Viewing videos on this device ID a pleasure. ✓ 3 major Android upgrades promised by Vivo ✓ Build quality is pretty solid. Aurora Dawn colour is eyecatching.  Overall to summarise the review, i would say that if you a photography lover do go for this without a doubt. The photography on this phone is on another level. Don't bother about the SoC, Dimensity 1200 is more than enough to handle your day to day work and some gaming ...\n",

People will say in this price segment processor is low. But it does not affect daily task and often gaming. Night mode is also very impressive.

      "Rating: 4, Review: NOT A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW, BUT AS A GENERAL USER WHAT I FEEL IS WRITTEN HERE:  The frost blue color, look, side profile is really best. I mean the holding factor in hand is very lavish. Back cover provided is good as well as the screen protector is provided on the screen itself. Charging is fast. Takes around 1 hour to get fully charged. Back camera is good, 2X zoom is fine and after it as u zoom in, it starts missing details at higher zoom levels. Upto 5X levels it's file but 20X zoom is worst i may say. The portrait, wide angle, night mode, object tracking, filters, everything is good. No worries about using these futures. Macro is fine and super macro requires a bit of practice to get used to. Also it gives grains in pictures in super macro mode. Looks like painting sometimes. Front camera sometimes losses details under heavy backlight. Otherwise it's very good in better lighting conditions. Heats up when using camera for more than 12-15 minutes. The sound/audio, speaker, mic everything is just fine. Earphone (3.5 mm jack) is given and a connector is provided to connect it with C type port provided in the phone. Battery backup is fine. Not much on higher or lower side. The display is complete treat to use. Also the touch is fast and responsive. The fingerprint sensor sometimes not identifying the finger else it's fast too. As well as the face detection works without any hesitation. Expecting good processor, better picture resolution at higher zoom levels and atleast 4500 mAH battery. 33K price is too much for this model, though I got it at 27,999 in sale. (May be 25K is a good deal for this phone)  Design: 10 Battery & charging: 8 Processor: 7 Speed: 9 OS: 7.5 Camera Front & back: 8.5 Finger print scanner: 7 Face detection: 9\n",

I also ordered realme x3 super zoom and later cancelled. As I have never used any vivo device earlier but ordered this one, thinking that will return if will not suit. Mobile is too good, sharp screen, 120htz was not my need. Cam has lot many features if u are fond of posting pics on social media and like night photography 📸, I tell you it's awesome although the wide angle is average. The cost is slightly high it's ultimate. Even I am looking forward to buying x50pro for myself if price subsidized in future.\n",

Vivo phone looks premium and functionality is top notch.  Coming to X50  Pro 1. Superb display. AMOLED is treat to use on daily basis 2. Call quality is good 3. Camera is superb. I have DSLR too but you cant compare any mobile photos to DSLR. Having said that camera is really good. Top class 4. Music - sound is crystal clear 5. 45 Mins to 0-100% charge 6. You will get very good ear phones from Vivo - didnt expected that  Cons 1. Back is slippery anyways we all will use back cover so dont worry much 2. Camera layout is not classy - Bit sober in design 3. Price bit high, i got this from 26K on exchanging my old phone (25K is ideal price for this phone)\n",

Camera performance is good, especially the portrait shots which gives you an added advantage of Bokeh adjust after shot. In other modes, camera performance is okayish, nothing out of the box as Vivo claims. Display is awesome. Battery backup is okay but on the first day it drained very fast. I would advice you to charge the phone on the first day for 1 or 2 hours more after it shows full charge. Its kind of overpriced. Had it been somewhere in the range of 25K, I would have given it a 5 star.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using this for last 1week, So far very positive. Let's discuss the negatives first: 1. Speaker is loud, good quality but not stereo. In this price is a honest cutting from vivo. 2. Full of bloatwares, some significant effort a person needs to make all bloat apps uninstalled or permissions turned off.  Positives: 1. Camera, very well. Even hopeless 2MP macro lens did its job well. 2. 5g speed is good, got around 1.5Gbs with Jio 3. Display is good and bright, using in outdoors\n",

It's camera is fantastic 😻 Ear speaker, mic, speaker really nice. It's performance is also good. As it's 5G handset, internet speed is quite impressive. I got 20mb++/second during downloading with 4G data pack.  Main issue with Battery 🔋 drain so fast... Battery is the biggest concern for me now. To get tempered glass for curve display seems too difficult BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ISSUE Overall very nice.  Thank you!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using this for last 1week, So far very positive. Let's discuss the negatives first: 1. Speaker is loud, good quality but not stereo. In this price is a honest cutting from vivo. 2. Full of bloatwares, some significant effort a person needs to make all bloat apps uninstalled or permissions turned off.  Positives: 1. Camera, very well. Even hopeless 2MP macro lens did its job well. 2. 5g speed is good, got around 1.5Gbs with Jio 3. Display is good and bright, using in outdoors\n",

I got 20mb++/second during downloading with 4G data pack.  Main issue with Battery 🔋 drain so fast... Battery is the biggest concern for me now. To get tempered glass for curve display seems too difficult BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ISSUE Overall very nice.  Thank you!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is my personal opinion of the Vivo V27, based on the experience of using it for the past 15 days.  Pros:  Good primary camera with high resolution and pro mode, which clicks good HD photos.  Front camera is also good, with much clarity.  No lag as of now, indicating good performance.  Light weight, making it easy to carry around.  Cons:  Battery could have been bigger, indicating that we might need to charge it more frequently than you'd like, if we use internet often. Without the usage of 5g internet, battery might hold longer.  Overall, you find it to be a decent mobile phone for its price range of 30-37k. Additionally, I was able to get a good deal on it, thanks to the exchange bonus and credit card offer, which made the purchase even more attractive. This is about my thoughts and experiences with the Vivo V27.  - PRV\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Everything is perfect according to its price except no memory card slot which I think is a big flow. I keep many big files. The camara is almost very perfect. Selfie is the king. But yes after few days of use the camara app lags. Here and there it gitters glitches. Only camara app has this issue. It also heats up if u use camara more than 10-15 minutes simultaneously. Bettery backup is very good. Last about a day in normal use even after it has only 4600mAh battery. Charges very quick with its 66w charger. Mine takes around 40-45 minutes to charge zero to one hundred. And 50 to 100 takes about 15-20 minutes. If u play games likes pubg battery will drown drastically. And might heatup a little. Rest is all ok. No other complaints or issues I have seen yet after using it for a month.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Dont get me wrong vivo, if you release a mobile in the budget og 36k then you should consider some latest features. People giving you 36k and its not a small amount in India for buying a mobile. You should consider 1. USB C type port. 2. Larger pixel primary camera (minimum 16mp), camera quality not so good, even vivo v9 has better camera. 3. Though vivo used a high mid range chip but the phone cant handle gaming as good as others mobile in the same category. 4. No water resistant at all.  But yes, you made it 1st ever in Mobile industry, the on screen finger print and it works like buttery smooth (not so fast, but accurate). Good display quality.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Vivo X21 was bought in an exchange deal. I preferred to buy this phone because of it's Display, Camera, Performance, and the Weight. This is one of the best phones from Vivo, however too much priced. Thanks to the exchange deal, I settled to buy for descent price. All features are appreciable in this phone: except for Funtouch OS that comes bundled with Android OS and the pathetic Battery performance. With frequent usage throughout the day, battery is drained out. I sometimes have to charge twice in a day, when I use the phone too frequently from Morning till Evening. But, Yes this phone is awesome, and it comes with thin Protective Screen and a Back Case. Phone is very slim, even with Back Case on, and is very convenient to use when operated with single hand.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: This product boasts nice fingerprint and display but it lacks HD support.. \"No widevine L1 support\" is such a shame to such a high end model !! Vivo should give widevine L1 support through OTA update!! Camera is nice and fast!! Battery gives 8-10 hrs to a medium user, though OS seems unstable with variable battery performance !! Dual quick charge is great feature, 15 minutes charging gives you 20 -30% of battery ! HD streaming support and USB type C would have been perfect!!\n",

Very good camera (both front and rear), very good touch, very good battery and one thing I liked the most that it detects my face in low light easily even in complete darkness. Just one thing I didn't like and that is Flipkart exchange procedure. I have to wait for three hours to open my box as the Flipkart person told me to not to open the box until the exchanged phone is verified by warehouse technical team......It's not good, one who accepts exchange must be technically sound so that he can decide yes or no on the spot.\n",

The looks are pretty good on this phone. and pretty descent cover and eaphones you get inside the box. last thing which really mattrr is fast charging which is equivalent to oneplus dash charge though it has micro usb support but it juice up 60% in jus 30mins. That's all.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: I have got serious complaint regarding the delivery boy of the product.The unprofessional attitude together with the rudeness amplified would be less if I had to describe this. I was forced to come on the road to collect the phone else he threatened to take it back undelivered. This certainly does not match with ekart or flipkart's image. I personally think that such staffs should be fired off immediately.\n",

      "Rating: 1, Review: All chinese phone company making us fool in name of camera megapixel, ram and nothing more. They always keep increasing prices with new models. My vivo z1x 32 mp camera is equivalent or less as compartive to this vivo 25 pro. Price double camera double but performance of camera is same. Chinese believe that customers are fool in Indian market, they keep selling us same thing in new package.  Phone software is also stuck somewhere like you can not copy a part of url from url address bar in chrome app. Globel search hangs when you try to go back after a search.  Seller EcommerceMobile is also not good.\n",

Portrait mode is just awesome. Looks like expensive DSLR image. Edge detection is accurate. Colour representation is mind blowing. Nothing to complain about the camera department. People will say in this price segment processor is low. But it does not affect daily task and often gaming. Night mode is also very impressive. Video stabilization is very good and sound recording in video also very impressive which is a great option for video bloggers. No network and calling issue after a update. Calls are clear and loud.  Nothing to complain.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: NOT A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW, BUT AS A GENERAL USER WHAT I FEEL IS WRITTEN HERE:  The frost blue color, look, side profile is really best. I mean the holding factor in hand is very lavish. Back cover provided is good as well as the screen protector is provided on the screen itself. Charging is fast. Takes around 1 hour to get fully charged. Back camera is good, 2X zoom is fine and after it as u zoom in, it starts missing details at higher zoom levels. Upto 5X levels it's file but 20X zoom is worst i may say. The portrait, wide angle, night mode, object tracking, filters, everything is good. No worries about using these futures. Macro is fine and super macro requires a bit of practice to get used to. Also it gives grains in pictures in super macro mode. Looks like painting sometimes. Front camera sometimes losses details under heavy backlight. Otherwise it's very good in better lighting conditions. Heats up when using camera for more than 12-15 minutes. The sound/audio, speaker, mic everything is just fine. Earphone (3.5 mm jack) is given and a connector is provided to connect it with C type port provided in the phone. Battery backup is fine. Not much on higher or lower side. The display is complete treat to use. Also the touch is fast and responsive. The fingerprint sensor sometimes not identifying the finger else it's fast too. As well as the face detection works without any hesitation. Expecting good processor, better picture resolution at higher zoom levels and atleast 4500 mAH battery. 33K price is too much for this model, though I got it at 27,999 in sale. (May be 25K is a good deal for this phone)  Design: 10 Battery & charging: 8 Processor: 7 Speed: 9 OS: 7.5 Camera Front & back: 8.5 Finger print scanner: 7 Face detection: 9\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I was really confused when my brother asked for the mobile with a good cam. I checked one plus Nord as I was already a fan of oneplus. I also ordered realme x3 super zoom and later cancelled. As I have never used any vivo device earlier but ordered this one, thinking that will return if will not suit. Mobile is too good, sharp screen, 120htz was not my need. Cam has lot many features if u are fond of posting pics on social media and like night photography 📸, I tell you it's awesome although the wide angle is average. The cost is slightly high it's ultimate. Even I am looking forward to buying x50pro for myself if price subsidized in future.\n",

Front camera is average. Processor is not adequate in this price segment. But not good as vivo v20. V20 is a camera king under 25k. Better go with v20 it's a value for money in 2021.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely Brilliant  I have used xiaomi, Realme and Vivo phone in the past 3-4 years. The design and build and software of Vivo is way ahead of others.  Vivo phone looks premium and functionality is top notch.  Coming to X50  Pro 1. Superb display. AMOLED is treat to use on daily basis 2. Call quality is good 3. Camera is superb. I have DSLR too but you cant compare any mobile photos to DSLR. Having said that camera is really good. Top class 4. Music - sound is crystal clear 5. 45 Mins to 0-100% charge 6. You will get very good ear phones from Vivo - didnt expected that  Cons 1. Back is slippery anyways we all will use back cover so dont worry much 2. Camera layout is not classy - Bit sober in design 3. Price bit high, i got this from 26K on exchanging my old phone (25K is ideal price for this phone)\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: I am writing this review after almost 1 week of usage. Camera performance is good, especially the portrait shots which gives you an added advantage of Bokeh adjust after shot. In other modes, camera performance is okayish, nothing out of the box as Vivo claims. Display is awesome. Battery backup is okay but on the first day it drained very fast. I would advice you to charge the phone on the first day for 1 or 2 hours more after it shows full charge. Its kind of overpriced. Had it been somewhere in the range of 25K, I would have given it a 5 star.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome phone  I am writing the review after almost a week of use. Pros: 1. Very good design both in front and back. 2. Lightweight and feels premium in your hand. 3. Beautiful display, treat to your eyes AMOLED, curved screen and 120hz adaptive refresh rate adds to its beauty. 4. Front camera- beautiful, Sony imx 709 really takes beautiful pics in every condition. Back camera: Main camera really works even in low light condition and 32 MP telephoto lens is not a gimmick. It really helps in taking clear pics of distant objects. 5. IR blaster, NFC is there but not making big difference for me.  Cons: 1. Processor: 778G, really in 39k, feels like 20k processor to me. Even a lower priced Reno 10 has a better clocked (2.6GHZ) processor. I was expecting at least dimensity 8200 in this price range. 2. Single speaker. At this price it should have been Dolby Atmos. 3. Battery: 4600 mah is ok ok for me as I am not a gamer and for normal day to day use it lasts one day easily but 5000 could have been better. 4. No IP rating in this price range is a big disappointment.  Even after the drawbacks I gave it a 5* for its design, display and camera. I got the phone at a good bank discount and a handsome exchange offer. I preferred it over Nord 3 for its camera performance and Nord 3's display problem. Overall Its a good buy.\n",
